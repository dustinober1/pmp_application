D: Formally documenting security policy first (distractor) prioritizes governance over understanding, potentially alienating the supervisors who need to see how their knowledge translates. A: Creating a sandbox environment (distractor) delays vision development by focusing on exploration before alignment, and might not address the core fear of context loss.

B: This proactively seeks to understand the specific concern (isolating vectors) and proposes a concrete, time-bound action for negotiation, which manages the immediate expectation of action. C: This focuses immediately on schedule impact, which can be perceived as prioritizing deadlines over ethics, and demanding they narrow the scope is less collaborative than proposing internal findings first. A: Documenting risk is necessary but passive; it does not address the immediate threat of a public statement or the stakeholder's specific finding of bias amplification.

C: Mandatory training addresses 'how to use it' but not 'why the output is frustratingly frequent'; it imposes a solution rather than collaboratively adjusting the tool.

The initial vision workshop yielded enthusiasm, but real-world application has caused anxiety about job displacement and process disruption. What should you do FIRST to re-establish a unified path forward?",

Addressing these deeply felt concerns directly and immediately via structured feedback is the necessary first step to re-establish psychological safety and re-engage the team toward the vision. D: This directly confronts the source of resistance (fear/job security) through immediate dialogue, which is fundamental to developing a common vision when trust is wavering. C: Reverting to mandates ignores the underlying human element and may increase resistance, as it lacks empathy. A: Involving HR and technical leads is good for planning, but it bypasses the immediate need to listen to and acknowledge the current team's anxiety first. B: Pausing deployment avoids the conflict; the team needs to understand the 'why' and 'how' of the vision before adjusting the 'what' or 'when'.",

A hardening sprint, focused on defining quality and acceptance criteria collaboratively, validates their need for thoroughness while integrating them into the Agile cycle. B: This approach uses their existing strength (detailed analysis) to define Agile success for the team, minimizing anxiety while still adopting the iterative rhythm. A: Negotiating reduced frequency undermines the principle of frequent feedback, which is core to Agile and needed to build the team's trust in the new process. C: Individual coaching is helpful, but the resistance is systemic (framework vs. deep work); addressing the team's definition of 'Done' collaboratively is more impactful initially. D: Spikes address uncertainty, but the core issue here is control and process disruption, not just lack of knowledge; defining quality criteria (B) addresses control needs better than time-boxing preparatory work.",

C: Quantifying benefits is important for buy-in but doesn't solve the process ambiguity perceived by the directors; they need operational pathways, not just financial forecasts.
