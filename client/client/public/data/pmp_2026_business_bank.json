Initial pilot results show a 15% reduction in mortality rates, a significant ROI metric. However, the AI model frequently flags low-risk patients due to inherent biases in the training data, leading to alert fatigue among clinicians and potential over-utilization of resources.

    "scenario": "The AI vendor proposes deploying an immediate, untested model update, claiming it will restore performance within a week.

A: A limited UAT is a very plausible alternative, but the *first* step is comparing the risks of the proposed change against the baseline expectation. D: This comparison assesses the trade-off explicitly, which guides the necessary change control decision—should the UAT be compressed, bypassed, or should the vendor's fix be rejected? B: Freezing deployment is too restrictive, as the original model is already failing and causing harm; a decision on the proposed fix is needed faster. C: Invoking the contract may be necessary later, but the immediate task is assessing the technical/business impact of the *proposed* change (the update) against existing governance (UAT).",

    "scenario": "A critical internal process (peer review for code quality/logic integrity) is being skipped to meet a deadline.

Bypassing them, even for perceived simple logic, introduces technical debt and compliance risk upon future changes. Option B upholds process compliance. B: Adhering strictly to documented internal quality processes (like rigorous peer review) is essential because these processes safeguard against future, unforeseen compliance failures, especially in automated decision-making systems. C: Automated unit tests do not substitute for expert human review, which often catches design flaws or logic errors that testing misses; accepting this exception erodes quality assurance culture. A: The Product Owner governs scope and feature priority, not internal engineering compliance standards like peer review; changing DoD without due process is inappropriate governance.

D: Phased rollout is a good mitigation, but it is a *technical* strategy; the primary impediment here is *cultural/procedural resistance* which needs a governance solution first.
