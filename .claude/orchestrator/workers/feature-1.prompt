You are a worker agent focused on implementing a single feature.

## Your Task
Add database schema to support domain filtering on tests

## Orchestration Context
Add the ability for tests to be broken down by task area/domain, not just one big test. Currently, PracticeTest represents one large test with 185 questions. We need to support creating tests that focus on specific domains (People, Process, Business Environment) or combinations of domains.

Current structure:
- Questions belong to Domains via domainId
- Tests link to questions via TestQuestion junction table
- 3 domains exist: People (33%), Process (41%), Business Environment (26%)

Requirements:
1. Support creating domain-specific tests (e.g., "People Domain Practice Test")
2. Allow tests to include questions from one or multiple domains
3. Update admin API to accept domain filters when creating tests
4. Update user-facing API to show domain coverage for each test
5. Add sample domain-specific tests to seed data
6. Maintain backward compatibility with existing full-length tests


## Instructions
1. Focus ONLY on implementing this specific feature
2. Make small, incremental changes
3. Test your changes as you go
4. When you are DONE, create a file at: .claude/orchestrator/workers/feature-1.done
   with a brief summary of what you implemented
5. Do NOT commit your changes - the orchestrator will handle commits

## Important
- Do not work on other features
- If you encounter a blocker, document it in the .done file and stop
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- NEVER commit, stage, or git add ANY of these files:
  - .claude/ (entire directory - orchestrator state, logs, prompts, worker files)
  - claude-progress.txt
  - init.sh
  - *.prompt, *.log, *.done, *.status files in .claude/


## Additional Context
You need to add database schema support for domain filtering on tests. 

Current schema (prisma/schema.prisma):
- PracticeTest model exists with basic fields (name, description, totalQuestions, etc.)
- Domain model exists with fields (id, name, description, weightPercentage, color)
- TestQuestion is a junction table linking PracticeTest to Questions
- Questions have a domainId field linking to Domain

Implementation approach:
1. Add a many-to-many relation between PracticeTest and Domain using a new junction table "TestDomain"
2. This allows tests to specify which domain(s) they cover
3. Keep it optional - existing tests without domain filters remain full-spectrum
4. Add helpful comments explaining the purpose

Schema to add:
```prisma
model TestDomain {
  id        String       @id @default(uuid())
  testId    String
  domainId  String
  test      PracticeTest @relation(fields: [testId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  domain    Domain       @relation(fields: [domainId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  
  @@unique([testId, domainId])
  @@map("test_domains")
}
```

Then add the relation fields:
- Add `domains TestDomain[]` to PracticeTest model
- Add `tests TestDomain[]` to Domain model

After updating schema, run:
1. npx prisma format
2. npx prisma migrate dev --name add_test_domain_filtering
3. Verify migration file looks correct

Don't modify any other files - just focus on the Prisma schema changes.

Begin implementing the feature now.
