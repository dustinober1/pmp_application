You are a worker agent focused on implementing a single feature.

## Your Task
Analyze existing codebase structure and identify patterns

## Orchestration Context
Analyze the PMP application codebase and create specialized agents/workers for ongoing development. This includes:
1. Database/Prisma schema management and migration agents
2. API route and service layer scaffolding agents
3. Frontend component and page generation agents
4. Test generation and coverage management agents
5. Authentication and subscription tier feature agents
6. Spaced repetition (SM-2) algorithm tuning agents
7. Content management (study guides, questions, flashcards) agents
8. Team/corporate feature development agents

The goal is to create reusable agent configurations, templates, and tools that can be invoked for future development tasks.

## Project Context Files
### From CLAUDE.md:
# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A comprehensive PMP (Project Management Professional) study platform for the 2026 exam with tiered subscriptions (free, mid-level, high-end, corporate). Built as a monorepo using npm workspaces.

**Tech Stack**: React 18 + Next.js, Node.js + Express, PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM, Redis (optional), Jest + fast-check

## Development Commands

### Workspace-level Commands
```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Start all development servers (API + Web)
npm run dev

# Build all packages
npm run build

# Run tests across all packages
npm run test

# Lint and format
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
npm run format
npm run format:check
```

### Package-specific Commands
```bash
# API server (packages/api)
npm run dev:api          # Start API dev server on port 3001
npm run build:api        # Build API
npm run test:api         # Run API tests
npm run test:watch -w @pmp/api    # Run tests in watch mode

# Web frontend (packages/web)
npm run dev:web          # Start Next.js dev server on port 3000
npm run build:web        # Build frontend

# Shared types (packages/shared)
npm run build:shared     # Build shared types
```

### Database Commands
```bash
# All database commands run in the API package
npm run db:generate      # Generate Prisma client (run after schema changes)
npm run db:migrate       # Create and apply new migration
npm run db:push          # Push schema changes without migration (dev only)
npm run db:seed          # Seed database with initial data
npm run db:studio        # Open Prisma Studio GUI (visual database browser)

# Start PostgreSQL + Redis with Docker
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose down
```

### Utility Commands
```bash
npm run clean            # Remove node_modules and dist folders across all packages
```

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage (API has 80% threshold)
npm run test:coverage -w @pmp/api

# Run a single test file
npx jest -w @pmp/api src/services/auth.service.test.ts

# Run tests matching a pattern
npx jest -w @pmp/api --testNamePattern "should validate email"
```

## Architecture

### Monorepo Structure
- `packages/api/` - Express backend with Prisma ORM
- `packages/web/` - Next.js frontend with TailwindCSS
- `packages/shared/` - Shared TypeScript types and constants used by both API and web

### API Architecture (packages/api/src)

**Layer Pattern**: Routes → Services → Database (via Prisma)

```
routes/          # Express route handlers, parameter validation with Zod
  ├── auth.routes.ts
  ├── subscription.routes.ts
  ├── domain.routes.ts      # Study content (domains/tasks)
  ├── flashcard.routes.ts
  ├── practice.routes.ts
  ├── formula.routes.ts
  ├── dashboard.routes.ts   # Analytics
  ├── team.routes.ts        # Corporate features
  └── search.routes.ts

services/        # Business logic, database queries, complex operations
  ├── auth.service.ts        # JWT, refresh tokens, password resets
  ├── subscription.service.ts # Tier management, PayPal integration
  ├── content.service.ts     # Domains, tasks, study guides
  ├── flashcard.service.ts   # SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm
  ├── practice.service.ts    # Questions, sessions, mock exams
  ├── formula.service.ts     # EVM formulas, calculator
  ├── dashboard.service.ts   # Progress analytics, weak areas
  └── team.service.ts        # Corporate team management

middleware/
  ├── auth.middleware.ts     # JWT verification, user extraction
  ├── tier.middleware.ts     # Subscription tier enforcement
  ├── error.middleware.ts    # Centralized error handling
  └── validation.middleware.ts

config/
  ├── env.ts                 # Environment validation with Zod
  └── database.ts            # Prisma client singleton

validators/                  # Zod schemas for request validation
```

**Key Patterns**:
- All routes use `/api` prefix (e.g., `/api/auth/login`)
-

## Instructions
1. Focus ONLY on implementing this specific feature
2. Make small, incremental changes
3. Test your changes as you go
4. When you are DONE, create a file at: .claude/orchestrator/workers/feature-1.done
   with a brief summary of what you implemented
5. Do NOT commit your changes - the orchestrator will handle commits

## Important
- Do not work on other features
- If you encounter a blocker, document it in the .done file and stop
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- NEVER commit, stage, or git add ANY of these files:
  - .claude/ (entire directory - orchestrator state, logs, prompts, worker files)
  - claude-progress.txt
  - init.sh
  - *.prompt, *.log, *.done, *.status files in .claude/


## Additional Context
Explore the entire codebase structure and document:
1. Current API routes, services, and their patterns
2. Prisma schema models and relationships
3. Frontend components structure and patterns
4. Testing patterns and coverage status
5. Shared types and constants
6. Configuration and environment setup

Create a comprehensive patterns document in `.claude/agents/patterns.md` that can be used as reference for all other agents. This should include:
- Code templates for routes, services, components
- Naming conventions
- Import patterns
- Zod validation patterns
- Prisma query patterns
- Testing patterns

This analysis will inform all subsequent agent creation tasks.
