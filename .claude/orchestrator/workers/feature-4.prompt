You are a worker agent focused on implementing a single feature.

## Your Task
Update practice test API to show domain breakdown

## Orchestration Context
Add the ability for tests to be broken down by task area/domain, not just one big test. Currently, PracticeTest represents one large test with 185 questions. We need to support creating tests that focus on specific domains (People, Process, Business Environment) or combinations of domains.

Current structure:
- Questions belong to Domains via domainId
- Tests link to questions via TestQuestion junction table
- 3 domains exist: People (33%), Process (41%), Business Environment (26%)

Requirements:
1. Support creating domain-specific tests (e.g., "People Domain Practice Test")
2. Allow tests to include questions from one or multiple domains
3. Update admin API to accept domain filters when creating tests
4. Update user-facing API to show domain coverage for each test
5. Add sample domain-specific tests to seed data
6. Maintain backward compatibility with existing full-length tests


## Instructions
1. Focus ONLY on implementing this specific feature
2. Make small, incremental changes
3. Test your changes as you go
4. When you are DONE, create a file at: .claude/orchestrator/workers/feature-4.done
   with a brief summary of what you implemented
5. Do NOT commit your changes - the orchestrator will handle commits

## Important
- Do not work on other features
- If you encounter a blocker, document it in the .done file and stop
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- NEVER commit, stage, or git add ANY of these files:
  - .claude/ (entire directory - orchestrator state, logs, prompts, worker files)
  - claude-progress.txt
  - init.sh
  - *.prompt, *.log, *.done, *.status files in .claude/


## Additional Context
You need to update the practice test API to show domain breakdown information.

Current implementation:
- Practice test APIs are in `src/controllers/practiceController.ts`
- Key endpoints: GET /api/practice/tests (list tests), GET /api/practice/tests/:id (get specific test)
- Currently returns basic test info (name, description, timeLimitMinutes, totalQuestions)

New requirements:
1. Include domain information when returning test data
2. Show which domains are covered by each test
3. For domain-specific tests (those with TestDomain records), show the domains
4. For full-spectrum tests (no TestDomain records), indicate "All Domains"
5. Include domain details: name, color, weightPercentage

Implementation approach:
1. Read `src/controllers/practiceController.ts` to understand current implementation
2. Update the Prisma queries to include the `domains` relation
3. Transform the response to include domain information:
   - If test.domains is empty, show all domains as covered
   - If test.domains has records, show only those specific domains
4. Update both the list endpoint and the detail endpoint
5. Ensure the response format is clean and includes: domainId, domainName, domainColor

Example desired response format:
```json
{
  "id": "test-uuid",
  "name": "People Domain Practice Test",
  "description": "...",
  "totalQuestions": 50,
  "timeLimitMinutes": 90,
  "domains": [
    {
      "id": "domain-uuid",
      "name": "People",
      "color": "#3B82F6"
    }
  ],
  "isFullSpectrum": false
}
```

Make sure to handle both cases properly and maintain backward compatibility.
