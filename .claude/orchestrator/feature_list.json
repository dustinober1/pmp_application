  "taskDescription": "Add the ability for tests to be broken down by task area/domain, not just one big test. Currently, PracticeTest represents one large test with 185 questions. We need to support creating tests that focus on specific domains (People, Process, Business Environment) or combinations of domains.\n\nCurrent structure:\n- Questions belong to Domains via domainId\n- Tests link to questions via TestQuestion junction table\n- 3 domains exist: People (33%), Process (41%), Business Environment (26%)\n\nRequirements:\n1. Support creating domain-specific tests (e.g., \"People Domain Practice Test\")\n2. Allow tests to include questions from one or multiple domains\n3. Update admin API to accept domain filters when creating tests\n4. Update user-facing API to show domain coverage for each test\n5. Add sample domain-specific tests to seed data\n6. Maintain backward compatibility with existing full-length tests",
