# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do **not** open a public issue.

Instead, report it privately to the maintainers with:
- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if possible)
- Affected versions/branches
- Any suggested remediation

## Response Timeline
We aim to acknowledge reports within **2 business days** and provide a remediation plan or request
more information shortly thereafter.
