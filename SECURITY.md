# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in PMP Study Pro, please email the maintainers directly instead of using the public issue tracker. This allows us to fix the issue and release a security update before public disclosure.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Affected versions
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if applicable)

## Security Considerations

PMP Study Pro is designed as an offline-first, client-side application with the following security characteristics:

- **No backend servers** - All data is stored locally in your browser
- **No authentication required** - The application requires no user login
- **No sensitive data transmission** - Your progress and study data never leave your device
- **Static content only** - The application is deployed as a static site on GitHub Pages

## Dependencies

We regularly update and audit our dependencies to ensure security. Please report any security vulnerabilities in our dependencies through the standard reporting process.

## Security Updates

When a security vulnerability is discovered and fixed, we will:

1. Fix the vulnerability
2. Release a new version
3. Announce the security update in the release notes
4. Credit the reporter (if desired)

## Scope

This security policy applies to the latest version of PMP Study Pro. Older versions may not receive security updates.
