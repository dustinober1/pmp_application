A: Establish a documented 'Technical Liaison Channel' for high-frequency, low-impact discussions, bypassing the formal CR process for exploratory technical topics.

During virtual stakeholder demos using mixed reality overlays to show planned upgrades, the veteran machine operators express deep skepticism, claiming the digital simulations fail to account for real-world vibration and heat tolerances. They expect the final product to behave exactly as they predict based on decades of experience. How do you BEST manage this specific stakeholder expectation gap?",
    "scenario": "Veteran operators distrust virtual demos of machinery upgrades, expecting real-world conditions (vibration/heat) that the simulation doesn't capture, creating a gap between digital expectation and operational reality.",

A small, focused physical POC addresses their specific skepticism directly. A: This directly bridges the gap between virtual representation and operational reality, which is the source of the expectation mismatch. B: Mandating virtual environment use when the core complaint is the inadequacy of that environment fails to manage the expectation conflict; it exacerbates it. C: While technical improvement is good, this is a complex, time-consuming process; a targeted physical test addresses the immediate expectation barrier much faster.
