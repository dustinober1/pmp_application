# 9.3 Tools & Templates (Monitoring & Closing Toolkit)

**ECO Task**: Manage and control changes

Use this page as a copy/paste toolkit for Monitoring & Controlling and Project Closure scenarios. It’s designed to match how the PMP exam phrases problems (“what should you do first?”).

## Monitoring Cadence (15-Minute Weekly Agenda)

- Progress vs baseline/backlog (milestones, burnup/burndown)
- Variances + trends (CPI/SPI or flow metrics)
- Top risks and issues (new, escalations, owners, due dates)
- Open change requests (status + decisions needed)
- Next week plan (what changes based on what we learned)

::: tip Exam shortcut
If there is a problem, you usually (1) analyze it, (2) decide an action, and (3) communicate it. “Doing work” without the decision step is often the wrong answer.

## Status Report Template (Predictive / Hybrid)

**One-page rule**: the sponsor should understand status in under 60 seconds and know what decisions are needed.

| Section                              | Content (fill-in template)                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Overall status (RAG)**             | Red / Amber / Green + 1-sentence reason     |
| **Accomplished (since last report)** | bullet list                                 |
| **Planned (next period)**            | bullet list                                 |
| **Schedule**                         | milestone status + forecast finish date     |
| **Cost**                             | budget spent + forecast (EAC) if applicable |
| **Key metrics**                      | CPI/SPI or burnup/CFD + interpretation      |
| **Top risks**                        | risk + owner + next action                  |
| **Top issues**                       | issue + owner + due date                    |
| **Change requests**                  | CRs submitted/approved + impact summary     |
| **Decisions needed**                 | decision + deadline + decision-maker        |

## EVM Worksheet (Mini Template)

Fill in the inputs, then compute the metrics.

| Input   | Value |
| ------- | ----: |
| **BAC** |       |
| **PV**  |       |
| **EV**  |       |
| **AC**  |       |

Quick reminder:

- `PV = % planned complete × BAC`
- `EV = % actually complete × BAC`

| Output            | Formula                 | Result |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | -----: |
| **CV**            | $EV - AC$               |        |
| **SV**            | $EV - PV$               |        |
| **CPI**           | $EV / AC$               |        |
| **SPI**           | $EV / PV$               |        |
| **EAC** (typical) | $BAC / CPI$             |        |
| **ETC**           | $EAC - AC$              |        |
| **VAC**           | $BAC - EAC$             |        |
| **TCPI**          | $(BAC - EV)/(BAC - AC)$ |        |

::: info Interpretation shortcuts

- **CPI < 1**: over budget; update forecast and analyze root cause.
- **SPI < 1**: behind schedule; confirm critical path impact and remove constraints.
- **TCPI > 1**: you must perform better than planned to hit the target; the higher it is, the less realistic the target is.

## Variance Log (Copy/Paste Template)

Use this when variances repeat or exceed thresholds (helps avoid “we saw it but did nothing”).

| Field                        | Example                                       |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Variance ID**              | V-007                                         |
| **Metric**                   | CPI / milestone slip / defect escape rate     |
| **Baseline vs actual**       | CPI target 1.0 vs current 0.92                |
| **Trend**                    | declining for 3 periods                       |
| **Threshold triggered?**     | Yes (below 0.95)                              |
| **Root cause hypothesis**    | rework due to unclear acceptance criteria     |
| **Action type**              | corrective / preventive / defect repair       |
| **Proposed action**          | add DoD checklist + story acceptance workshop |
| **Owner**                    | Delivery lead                                 |
| **Due date**                 | 2026-02-14                                    |
| **Requires change request?** | Yes/No (baseline impact?)                     |
| **Decision**                 | approved / rejected / deferred                |

| **Escalation path**        | Sponsor if unresolved by date               |

::: tip Exam shortcut
If it is happening **now**, it is usually an **issue** (issue log). If it might happen later, it is a **risk** (risk register).

## Risk Register (Monitoring Template)

| Field                             | Example                                                                          |

| **Risk (cause → event → impact)** | If vendor lead times increase → hardware arrives late → schedule slip to go-live |
| **Probability**                   | Medium                                                                           |

### Change Impact Analysis (Quick Matrix)

Use this when the exam says “analyze impact” and provides multiple options.

| Dimension              | Impact (Low/Med/High) | Notes |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ----- |
| Scope                  |                       |       |
| Schedule               |                       |       |
| Cost                   |                       |       |
| Quality                |                       |       |
| Risk                   |                       |       |
| Benefits/value         |                       |       |
| Resources              |                       |       |
| Procurements/contracts |                       |       |

## Decision Log (Copy/Paste Template)

Use this to keep governance clean: what was decided, by whom, when, and why.

| Field                   | Example                                            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Decision ID**         | D-006                                              |
| **Decision needed**     | Approve CR-014 (audit logging)                     |
| **Options considered**  | A implement now / B defer / C descope              |
| **Decision**            | Defer to next release                              |
| **Decision-maker**      | Sponsor / CCB / Product governance                 |
| **Decision date**       | 2026-02-03                                         |
| **Rationale**           | avoids rework; compliance deadline is next quarter |
| **Impacts/assumptions** | no baseline change this release                    |
| **Actions created**     | update roadmap + communicate to Ops                |

| **Data Source**     | Schedule model + task-level estimates |

### Schedule Forecast

| Confidence Level | Completion Date | Days from Today |
| ---------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| **P50 (50%)**    | 2026-06-15      | 120 days        |
| **P80 (80%)**    | 2026-07-01      | 136 days        |
| **P90 (90%)**    | 2026-07-15      | 150 days        |

### Cost Forecast

| Confidence Level | Total Cost | Variance from BAC |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| **P50 (50%)**    | $485,000   | -$15,000 (under)  |
| **P80 (80%)**    | $512,000   | +$12,000 (over)   |
| **P90 (90%)**    | $545,000   | +$45,000 (over)   |

### Key Risks Affecting Forecast

| Risk                   | Impact on P90 | Mitigation Status    |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| Vendor delay           | +14 days      | Response in progress |
| Resource availability  | +7 days       | Mitigated            |
| Integration complexity | +$25,000      | Monitoring           |

### Recommendation

Based on Monte Carlo analysis:

- **Commit to P80 date** (2026-07-01) for external stakeholders
- **Plan to P50 date** (2026-06-15) for internal targets
- **Reserve $27,000 contingency** to cover P80 cost scenario
