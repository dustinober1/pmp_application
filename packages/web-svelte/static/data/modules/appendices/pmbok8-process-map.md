#exam-prep

This appendix provides a quick reference for the **PMBOK 8th Edition** structure, including the updated focus areas, performance domains, and approximately 40 processes. Use this for exam preparation and practical reference.

::: tip Key Change in PMBOK 8
PMBOK 8 reintroduces processes (approximately 40, reduced from 49 in PMBOK 6) while retaining the principle-based approach of PMBOK 7. It organizes these processes into **5 Focus Areas** (similar to the traditional Process Groups).

## Quick Reference Cards

### Six Principles (PMBOK 8)
| # | Principle | Remember As |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Adopt a Holistic View | See the system |
| 2 | Focus on Value | Outcomes over outputs |
| 3 | Embed Quality | Build it in |
| 4 | Be an Accountable Leader | Own it |
| 5 | Integrate Sustainability | Triple bottom line |
| 6 | Build an Empowered Culture | Trust the team |

### Seven Performance Domains (PMBOK 8)
| Domain | Focus | Key Question |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| **Stakeholders** | Engagement, relationships | Who needs what from us? |
| **Team** | Performance, culture, growth | How do we work together? |
| **Development Approach** | Methodology, lifecycle | How will we deliver? |
| **Planning** | Scope, schedule, cost, resources | What, when, and how much? |
| **Work Performance** | Execution, quality, delivery | Are we delivering as planned? |
| **Delivery** | Value, outcomes, transition | Did we achieve the result? |
| **Governance** | Oversight, controls, decisions | Who decides and how? |

::: info Note
**Governance** replaces "Integration" as a distinct domain in PMBOK 8, reflecting the increased emphasis on this topic in the 2026 exam.

## Five Focus Areas (Process Groups Evolution)
PMBOK 8 reintroduces the familiar project lifecycle structure as **Focus Areas**:

### Overview
| Focus Area | Purpose | Key Activities |

| **Initiating** | Authorize and define the project | Charter, stakeholder identification |
| **Planning** | Establish scope, approach, and baselines | All planning documents and baselines |
| **Executing** | Perform the work | Build deliverables, manage team, engage stakeholders |
| **Monitoring & Controlling** | Track and adjust | Measure performance, control changes |
| **Closing** | Formalize completion | Closure activities, lessons learned, transition |

---

## Process by Focus Area

---

### Monitoring & Controlling Focus Area

---

### Closing Focus Area
| Process | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Close Project or Phase | Finalize all activities; formal closure |

---

## Domain to Focus Area Mapping
How Performance Domains relate to Focus Areas:

| Performance Domain | Primary Focus Areas |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Stakeholders** | Initiating, Executing, Monitoring |
| **Team** | Planning, Executing |
| **Development Approach** | Initiating, Planning |
| **Planning** | Planning |
| **Work Performance** | Executing, Monitoring |
| **Delivery** | Executing, Closing |
| **Governance** | All (especially Initiating, Monitoring) |

## Key Formula Quick Reference
| Formula | Purpose | Formula |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **EV** | Earned Value | % Complete × Budget |
| **CV** | Cost Variance | EV - AC |
| **SV** | Schedule Variance | EV - PV |
| **CPI** | Cost Performance Index | EV ÷ AC |
| **SPI** | Schedule Performance Index | EV ÷ PV |
| **EAC** | Estimate at Completion | BAC ÷ CPI (typical) |
| **ETC** | Estimate to Complete | EAC - AC |
| **VAC** | Variance at Completion | BAC - EAC |
| **TCPI** | To Complete Performance Index | (BAC - EV) ÷ (BAC - AC) |

### Interpretation
| Metric | > 1.0 | = 1.0 | < 1.0 |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| **CPI** | Under budget | On budget | Over budget |
| **SPI** | Ahead of schedule | On schedule | Behind schedule |

## Inputs, Tools/Techniques, Outputs (ITTOs) - Key Patterns
Rather than memorizing all ITTOs, recognize patterns:

### Common Inputs Across Processes
| Input | Where Used |
|-------|------------|
| Project Charter | All Planning, Initiating |
| Project Management Plan | Almost everything |
| Organizational Process Assets (OPAs) | Templates, lessons learned, policies |
| Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs) | Constraints, culture, market conditions |
| Work Performance Data | Monitoring processes |
| Risk Register | Risk, planning, execution |

### Common Tools/Techniques
| Tool/Technique | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| Expert Judgment | Everywhere (experience-based decisions) |
| Data Analysis | Monitoring, decision-making |
| Meetings | Communication, alignment |
| Interpersonal Skills | Leadership, negotiation, conflict resolution |

### Common Outputs
| Output | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Baselines (Scope, Schedule, Cost) | Benchmarks for monitoring |
| Change Requests | Formal modification proposals |
| Updates to PM Plan | Revisions as project evolves |
| Work Performance Reports | Status communication |
| Lessons Learned Register | Knowledge capture |

## 2026 Exam Emphasis Areas
Based on the updated ECO, focus study time on:

| Area | Weight | Key Topics |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Business Environment** | 26% | Strategic alignment, governance, value, sustainability, compliance |
| **Process** | 41% | Integrated change control, planning, monitoring, risk management |
| **People** | 33% | Team leadership, stakeholder engagement, conflict resolution |

### New/Enhanced for 2026
- **AI in Project Management** → See Chapter 10
- **Sustainability** → See 02-strategic/sustainability.md
- **Governance** → Integrated throughout; enhanced focus
- **Value Delivery** → Outcome-based thinking
- **Adaptive Approaches** → 60% Agile/Hybrid content

## Study Tips
### Don't Memorize, Understand
The 2026 exam tests **application**, not memorization. Instead of memorizing all 40 processes:

1. **Understand the purpose** of each Focus Area
2. **Know the flow**: Inputs → Work → Outputs
3. **Apply principles** to scenarios
4. **Practice scenarios** that require judgment

### Mental Model: The Project Flow
```
Strategy → Charter → Plan → Execute → Monitor → Deliver Value → Close
 ↑___________|___________|
 (Iterate and adapt)
```

### Quick Decision Framework
When facing a scenario question:
1. **What phase/focus area are we in?**
2. **What principle applies?**
3. **What should happen next?**
4. **Which answer focuses on value and stakeholders?**
