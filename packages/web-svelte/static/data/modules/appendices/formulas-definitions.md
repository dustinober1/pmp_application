## 1. Earned Value Management (EVM)

| Term | Formula / Definition | Good or Bad? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PV** (Planned Value) | What you should have done by now according to the schedule. | N/A |
| **EV** (Earned Value) | The budgeted value of the work actually completed. | N/A |
| **AC** (Actual Cost) | What you have actually paid to date. | N/A |
| **CPI** (Cost Performance Index) | `EV / AC` | > 1.0 = Under Budget<br>< 1.0 = Over Budget |
| **SPI** (Schedule Performance Index) | `EV / PV` | > 1.0 = Ahead of Schedule<br>< 1.0 = Behind Schedule |
| **CV** (Cost Variance) | `EV - AC` | Positive = Under Budget |
| **SV** (Schedule Variance) | `EV - PV` | Positive = Ahead of Schedule |
| **EAC** (Estimate at Completion) | `BAC / CPI` | Predicts a final project cost if current efficiency continues. |
| **TCPI** (To-Complete Performance Index) | `(BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC)` | > 1.0 = Harder to finish on budget<br>< 1.0 = Easier to finish on budget |

## 2. Estimation

| Term | Formula / Definition | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PERT (Beta) Distribution** | `(O + 4M + P) / 6` | Weighs the "Most Likely" outcome 4x to account for uncertainty. |
| **Triangular Distribution** | `(O + M + P) / 3` | Simple average; used when we have little historical data. |
| **Standard Deviation (SD)** | `(P - O) / 6` | Measures uncertainty/risk range. |

## 3. Communication

| Term | Formula | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Comm Channels** | `N(N-1) / 2` | Calculates the number of potential communication paths for N people. |

## 4. Critical Path Terms

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Critical Path** | The longest path through the network diagram; determines the shortest time to complete the project. Has zero float. |
| **Total Float** | The amount of time a task can be delayed without delaying the project. |
| **Free Float** | The amount of time a task can be delayed without delaying the *next* task. |
