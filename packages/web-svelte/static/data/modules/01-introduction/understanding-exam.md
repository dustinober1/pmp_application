## Modern Question Formats

Forget simple multiple-choice. The 2026 exam uses **Interactive Simulations**:

### Question Types You'll Encounter

| Type                                  | What it looks like (in practice)                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Case / Scenario (NEW)**             | A longer scenario (often with visuals) followed by a set of questions |
| **Graphic-Based (NEW)**               | Interpret charts/graphs/diagrams/images and answer questions          |
| **Enhanced Matching**                 | Drag items into the correct places (may include images/diagrams)      |
| **Point and Click**                   | Select the correct hotspot area on an image                           |
| **Multiple Choice (Single Response)** | 1 correct answer                                                      |
| **Multiple Response**                 | Select all that apply (more than 1 correct answer)                    |

### Scenario Sets (Mini Case Studies)

Some questions come in sets of 3-5 questions tied to a single project scenario. The scenario appears on the left, and questions appear on the right.

**Example Scenario:**

> _"Sarah is managing a hybrid software deployment project. The team uses 2-week sprints for development but follows a predictive approach for hardware installation. Three weeks before go-live, the vendor announces a 4-week delay in server delivery..."_

Questions then test different aspects:

1. What should Sarah do FIRST? _(Process)_
2. How should Sarah communicate with the sponsor? _(People)_
3. What is the impact on the business case? _(Business Environment)_

### Sample Question Formats

**Standard Multiple Choice:**

> A project manager discovers the project is 15% over budget at the 50% completion point. The CPI is 0.87. What should the project manager do FIRST?
>
> A. Inform the sponsor and request additional funding
> B. Reduce scope to bring costs back in line
> C. Analyze the root cause of the cost variance
> D. Document the variance and update the risk register

_Correct: C - Always analyze before taking action._

**Multiple Response (Select Two):**

> A Scrum Master notices that the team's velocity has declined for three consecutive sprints. Which TWO actions should the Scrum Master take?
>
> A. Assign additional resources to the team
> B. Facilitate a retrospective to identify root causes
> C. Report the decline to the Product Owner immediately
> D. Observe the Daily Scrum for impediments
> E. Increase the sprint duration to allow more work

_Correct: B and D - Facilitate discussion and observe before acting._

**Drag-and-Drop (Sequencing):**

> Arrange the following change management steps in the correct order:
>
> - Evaluate impact on baseline
> - Submit change request
> - Implement approved change
> - Update project documents
> - CCB reviews and decides

_Correct Order: Submit → Evaluate → CCB reviews → Implement → Update_

**Point-and-Click Example:**

> Given the burn-down chart below, click on the area that indicates when the team first fell behind the ideal line.

_You would click on the exact point where the actual line diverges above the ideal line._

## The PMP Mindset

Passing the exam requires adopting a specific "Servant Leader" mental model. When answering questions, always filter your choices through these principles:

### The "FIRST" Test

When a question asks "What should you do FIRST?":

1. **Analyze/Assess** before acting
2. **Consult** stakeholders before escalating
3. **Address the root cause**, not symptoms
4. **Follow process** before improvising

### The Servant Leader Framework

| Traditional Manager  | Servant Leader                    |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Directs and controls | Coaches and facilitates           |
| Punishes mistakes    | Creates learning opportunities    |
| Hoards information   | Shares knowledge openly           |
| Makes all decisions  | Empowers team decisions           |
| Focuses on tasks     | Focuses on people                 |
| Avoids conflict      | Addresses conflict constructively |

### The 5 Pillars of the PMP Mindset

1. **Analyze First**: Never take action (like firing a vendor or crashing a schedule) before assessing the impact. If "Analyze" or "Assess" is an option, it is usually the first step.
2. **Servant Leadership**: Empower the team. Remove blockers. Don't "direct" or "punish."
3. **Face-to-Face**: Direct collaboration is better than emails or rigid documents.
4. **Be Proactive**: Don't wait for a risk to happen. Don't escalate a problem to the sponsor until you have a solution or have exhausted your authority.
5. **Integrity**: Never lie, hide info, or cut corners on quality/safety.

### Common Exam Traps

| Trap                                        | Why It's Wrong                             | Better Answer                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| "Tell the team to work overtime"            | Violates sustainable pace; treats symptoms | Address root cause; negotiate scope   |
| "Escalate to the sponsor immediately"       | Bypasses your authority; no analysis       | Analyze first, then propose solutions |
| "Update the project plan to reflect actual" | Changes baseline without approval          | Follow change control process         |
| "Document the issue and continue"           | Passive; doesn't solve problem             | Take proactive corrective action      |
| "Fire/replace the underperformer"           | Punitive; no root cause analysis           | Coach, mentor, find root cause        |
| "Add resources to speed up"                 | May not help; Brooks's Law                 | Analyze critical path first           |

## Time Management Strategy

You have **240 minutes** for **185 questions** = ~1.3 minutes per question.

### Recommended Pacing

| Phase                              | Time       | Strategy                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Case-study section**             | ~70-85 min | Read once; answer the full set while the scenario is fresh |
| **Break 1**                        | 5 min      | Stand, stretch, hydrate                                    |
| **Independent questions (Part 1)** | ~70-80 min | Steady pace; mark uncertain questions and move on          |
| **Break 2**                        | 5 min      | Mental reset                                               |
| **Independent questions (Part 2)** | ~65-75 min | Protect focus; avoid second-guess spirals                  |
| **Buffer**                         | ~5-10 min  | Review flagged questions before submitting                 |

### Time Management Tips

1. **Don't dwell**: If stuck after 90 seconds, mark and move on
2. **First instinct**: Your first answer is usually correct; don't change without clear reason
3. **Read completely**: Many wrong answers are designed to trap speed-readers
4. **Eliminate obviously wrong**: Remove 1-2 options to improve odds
5. **Answer everything**: No penalty for guessing; never leave blanks
6. **Watch the clock**: Check time after every 20 questions
