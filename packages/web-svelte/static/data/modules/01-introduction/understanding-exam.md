## 📝 Modern Question Formats
Forget simple multiple-choice. The 2026 exam uses **Interactive Simulations**:

### Question Types You'll Encounter

| Type | What it looks like (in practice) |
|------|----------------------------------|
| **Case / Scenario (NEW)** | A longer scenario (often with visuals) followed by a set of questions |
| **Graphic-Based (NEW)** | Interpret charts/graphs/diagrams/images and answer questions |
| **Enhanced Matching** | Drag items into the correct places (may include images/diagrams) |
| **Point and Click** | Select the correct hotspot area on an image |
| **Multiple Choice (Single Response)** | 1 correct answer |
| **Multiple Response** | Select all that apply (more than 1 correct answer) |

### Scenario Sets (Mini Case Studies)
Some questions come in sets of 3-5 questions tied to a single project scenario. The scenario appears on the left, and questions appear on the right.

**Example Scenario:**
> *"Sarah is managing a hybrid software deployment project. The team uses 2-week sprints for development but follows a predictive approach for hardware installation. Three weeks before go-live, the vendor announces a 4-week delay in server delivery..."*

Questions then test different aspects:
1. What should Sarah do FIRST? *(Process)*
2. How should Sarah communicate with the sponsor? *(People)*
3. What is the impact on the business case? *(Business Environment)*

### Sample Question Formats

**Standard Multiple Choice:**
> A project manager discovers the project is 15% over budget at the 50% completion point. The CPI is 0.87. What should the project manager do FIRST?
> 
> A. Inform the sponsor and request additional funding  
> B. Reduce scope to bring costs back in line  
> C. Analyze the root cause of the cost variance  
> D. Document the variance and update the risk register

*Correct: C - Always analyze before taking action.*

**Multiple Response (Select Two):**
> A Scrum Master notices that the team's velocity has declined for three consecutive sprints. Which TWO actions should the Scrum Master take?
> 
> A. Assign additional resources to the team  
> B. Facilitate a retrospective to identify root causes  
> C. Report the decline to the Product Owner immediately  
> D. Observe the Daily Scrum for impediments  
> E. Increase the sprint duration to allow more work

*Correct: B and D - Facilitate discussion and observe before acting.*

**Drag-and-Drop (Sequencing):**
> Arrange the following change management steps in the correct order:
> 
> - Evaluate impact on baseline
> - Submit change request
> - Implement approved change
> - Update project documents
> - CCB reviews and decides

*Correct Order: Submit → Evaluate → CCB reviews → Implement → Update*

**Point-and-Click Example:**
> Given the burn-down chart below, click on the area that indicates when the team first fell behind the ideal line.

*You would click on the exact point where the actual line diverges above the ideal line.*

## 🧠 The PMP Mindset
Passing the exam requires adopting a specific "Servant Leader" mental model. When answering questions, always filter your choices through these principles:

### The "FIRST" Test
When a question asks "What should you do FIRST?":
1. **Analyze/Assess** before acting
2. **Consult** stakeholders before escalating
3. **Address the root cause**, not symptoms
4. **Follow process** before improvising

### The Servant Leader Framework

| Traditional Manager 🚫 | Servant Leader ✅ |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| Directs and controls | Coaches and facilitates |
| Punishes mistakes | Creates learning opportunities |
| Hoards information | Shares knowledge openly |
| Makes all decisions | Empowers team decisions |
| Focuses on tasks | Focuses on people |
| Avoids conflict | Addresses conflict constructively |

### The 5 Pillars of the PMP Mindset

1.  **Analyze First**: Never take action (like firing a vendor or crashing a schedule) before assessing the impact. If "Analyze" or "Assess" is an option, it is usually the first step.
2.  **Servant Leadership**: Empower the team. Remove blockers. Don't "direct" or "punish."
3.  **Face-to-Face**: Direct collaboration is better than emails or rigid documents.
4.  **Be Proactive**: Don't wait for a risk to happen. Don't escalate a problem to the sponsor until you have a solution or have exhausted your authority.
5.  **Integrity**: Never lie, hide info, or cut corners on quality/safety.

### Common Exam Traps

| Trap | Why It's Wrong | Better Answer |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| "Tell the team to work overtime" | Violates sustainable pace; treats symptoms | Address root cause; negotiate scope |
| "Escalate to the sponsor immediately" | Bypasses your authority; no analysis | Analyze first, then propose solutions |
| "Update the project plan to reflect actual" | Changes baseline without approval | Follow change control process |
| "Document the issue and continue" | Passive; doesn't solve problem | Take proactive corrective action |
| "Fire/replace the underperformer" | Punitive; no root cause analysis | Coach, mentor, find root cause |
| "Add resources to speed up" | May not help; Brooks's Law | Analyze critical path first |

## ⏱️ Time Management Strategy

You have **240 minutes** for **185 questions** = ~1.3 minutes per question.

### Recommended Pacing

| Phase | Time | Strategy |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Case-study section** | ~70-85 min | Read once; answer the full set while the scenario is fresh |
| **Break 1** | 5 min | Stand, stretch, hydrate |
| **Independent questions (Part 1)** | ~70-80 min | Steady pace; mark uncertain questions and move on |
| **Break 2** | 5 min | Mental reset |
| **Independent questions (Part 2)** | ~65-75 min | Protect focus; avoid second-guess spirals |
| **Buffer** | ~5-10 min | Review flagged questions before submitting |

### Time Management Tips

1. **Don't dwell**: If stuck after 90 seconds, mark and move on
2. **First instinct**: Your first answer is usually correct; don't change without clear reason
3. **Read completely**: Many wrong answers are designed to trap speed-readers
4. **Eliminate obviously wrong**: Remove 1-2 options to improve odds
5. **Answer everything**: No penalty for guessing; never leave blanks
6. **Watch the clock**: Check time after every 20 questions
