# 1.4f – Professional Responsibility and Ethics

**ECO Task**: Plan and manage project compliance

Project management is not just about mechanics; it is about doing the right thing for stakeholders, the team, and the organization. The PMI Code of Ethics is foundational to the PMP certification and is **tested on the exam**.

---

## 1.4f.1 The PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct

The PMI Code of Ethics is built on four core values. Each has both **aspirational** standards (what we strive for) and **mandatory** standards (what we must do).

### The Four Core Values

| Value              | Definition                                                 | Aspirational                                                 | Mandatory                                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Responsibility** | Owning your decisions and their consequences               | Take responsibility for actions; seek continuous improvement | Report unethical conduct; comply with laws and regulations |
| **Respect**        | Valuing others, their time, and their diverse perspectives | Be inclusive; listen actively; value different viewpoints    | Don't discriminate; protect confidential information       |
| **Fairness**       | Making impartial decisions based on facts and merit        | Show transparency in decision-making                         | Avoid conflicts of interest; don't use favoritism          |
| **Honesty**        | Communicating truthfully, even when the news is bad        | Build trust through transparency                             | Don't deceive others; disclose truth promptly              |

### Aspirational vs. Mandatory Standards

| Type             | Description                          | Enforcement                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Aspirational** | Ideals we strive for; best practices | Character development; not enforced    |
| **Mandatory**    | Required conduct; non-negotiable     | Violations can result in PMI sanctions |

::: warning Exam Critical
On the PMP exam, **mandatory standards always apply**. If an answer choice violates a mandatory ethical standard, it is ALWAYS wrong, regardless of how practical it might seem.

## 1.4f.2 Ethical Challenges in Practice

### Conflicts of Interest

A conflict of interest occurs when your personal interests could influence (or appear to influence) your professional judgment.

**Examples:**

- Your friend's company is bidding on a project contract
- You own stock in a vendor being evaluated
- A family member works for a competing organization
- You could personally benefit from a project decision

**Required Actions:**

1. **Disclose** the relationship or interest immediately to relevant parties
2. **Recuse** yourself from decision-making where appropriate
3. **Document** the disclosure and any resulting arrangements
4. **Follow** organizational policies on conflicts

### Integrity in Reporting

You have a professional obligation to report project status honestly, even when the news is bad.

| Scenario                                       | Unethical Action                  | Ethical Action                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Project is failing but sponsor wants good news | Report "Green" status             | Report accurate "Red" status with mitigation plan |
| Metrics show budget overrun                    | Hide the data                     | Disclose variance and explain cause               |
| Schedule slipping but deadline is political    | Pretend it's on track             | Be transparent; propose alternatives              |
| Vendor missed quality requirements             | Accept anyway due to relationship | Document deficiency; follow contract terms        |

### Respecting the Team

| Principle                | What It Means                               | What It Looks Like                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Psychological Safety** | Team members feel safe to speak up          | No blame for raising concerns; welcome diverse viewpoints     |
| **Sustainable Pace**     | Don't enforce unsustainable work hours      | Reasonable expectations; no unnecessary "crunch"              |
| **Confidentiality**      | Handle personal or sensitive data with care | Protect private information; share only on need-to-know basis |
| **Inclusion**            | Value all team members equally              | Fair treatment regardless of background, role, or location    |
| **Autonomy**             | Respect professional judgment               | Allow self-organization; don't micromanage                    |

## 1.4f.3 Speaking Up (Whistleblowing)

When you observe unethical or illegal behavior, you have a professional obligation to act.

### The Escalation Path

| Step | Action                                     | When to Use                                                  |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Gather facts**                           | Before making any accusations; document what you observed    |
| 2    | **Speak to the person directly** (if safe) | When it might be an honest mistake or misunderstanding       |
| 3    | **Report to supervisor**                   | When direct conversation isn't appropriate or didn't resolve |
| 4    | **Report to management/sponsor**           | When supervisor is involved or non-responsive                |
| 5    | **Report to HR/Ethics Hotline**            | Formal organizational channels for serious matters           |
| 6    | **Report to external authority**           | When laws are being broken and internal channels failed      |

### What to Report

| Report                       | Don't Report                              |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Safety violations            | Personal disagreements                    |
| Fraud or corruption          | Matters of opinion                        |
| Harassment or discrimination | Rumors or hearsay                         |
| Illegal activities           | Minor policy infractions (unless pattern) |
| Serious ethics violations    | Anonymous complaints without evidence     |

### Protection from Retaliation

- **PMI supports whistleblowers** who report in good faith
- Many jurisdictions have legal protections
- Document your reports and follow proper channels

## 1.4f.4 Cultural Considerations in Global Teams

Ethical practices can vary across cultures, but PMI standards are universal.

### Common Tensions

| Area              | Cultural Variation                                  | PMI Standard                                                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Gift-giving**   | Normal business practice in some cultures           | Avoid if it could be seen as bribery; follow organizational policy |
| **Hierarchy**     | Some cultures expect deference to authority         | Speak up about concerns regardless of hierarchy                    |
| **Communication** | Direct vs. indirect styles                          | Ensure truthful communication; adapt style, not substance          |
| **Relationships** | Personal relationships matter more in some cultures | Disclose conflicts; maintain professional boundaries               |
| **Time**          | Flexible vs. strict time orientation                | Honor commitments; communicate delays                              |

### Key Principles for Global Ethics

1. **PMI Code applies everywhere** - It's not relative to local culture
2. **Respect cultural differences** - In communication style, not ethical substance
3. **When in doubt, disclose** - Transparency prevents problems
4. **Document cross-cultural decisions** - Create clarity for all parties
5. **Seek guidance** - When facing unclear ethical situations

## 1.4f.5 Ethical Dilemma Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The Generous Vendor

> A vendor you're evaluating for a major contract invites you to an all-expenses-paid conference at a resort, saying it's "educational."

**Analysis**: This could be perceived as a bribe to influence your decision.
**Action**: Decline the invitation. Disclose the offer to your supervisor. Document the situation.

### Scenario 2: The Pressure to Cut Corners

> Your sponsor insists you skip final testing to meet a deadline, saying "it's good enough" and the testing can happen after launch.

**Analysis**: This compromises quality and could harm users.
**Action**: Explain the risks clearly. Document the conversation. If overruled, document the decision and who made it.

### Scenario 3: The Hidden Scope Change

> A key stakeholder asks you to add a small feature "off the books" to avoid the change control process.

**Analysis**: This violates change management and is potentially fraudulent.
**Action**: Decline. Explain the proper change request process. Offer to expedite if urgent.

### Scenario 4: The Inaccurate Resume

> You discover a team member exaggerated their qualifications on their resume after they were hired.

**Analysis**: This is a fraud matter; it's not your decision alone.
**Action**: Report to HR. Don't ignore it or handle it yourself.

### Scenario 5: The Personal Relationship

> Your best friend's company is one of three finalists for a project contract. You're on the selection committee.

**Analysis**: Clear conflict of interest.
**Action**: Disclose the relationship immediately. Recuse yourself from the evaluation.

### Scenario 6: The Cultural Gift

> While working in a country where gift-giving is customary, a government official offers you an expensive watch.

**Analysis**: Acceptance could be seen as bribery, even if culturally normal.
**Action**: Politely decline. Explain your organization's policies. Offer a modest, compliant alternative exchange.

### Scenario 7: Data Privacy Breach

> A team member uses a public AI tool to summarize confidential project data, improving efficiency.

**Analysis**: Sensitive data is now in a public system—violation of data privacy.
**Action**: Report the incident. Follow data breach protocols. Educate the team on approved tools.

## 1.4f.6 On the Exam: Ethics Scenarios

### The Golden Rule

**If an answer is legally or ethically questionable, it is NEVER the correct answer, no matter how much time or money it saves.**

### Decision Framework for Ethics Questions

1. **Is there a law involved?** → Follow the law. Always.
2. **Is there a conflict of interest?** → Disclose it.
3. **Does it violate transparency?** → Choose honesty.
4. **Does it harm stakeholders?** → Protect them.
5. **What would a reasonable, ethical professional do?** → Choose that.

### Good Answers (Ethics Questions)

| Situation                        | Best Answer                          |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Conflict of interest discovered  | Disclose and recuse                  |
| Pressure to hide bad news        | Report truthfully with analysis      |
| Unethical request from sponsor   | Explain concerns; document decision  |
| Colleague behaving unethically   | Gather facts; escalate appropriately |
| Gift offered that could be bribe | Decline politely; follow policy      |
| Asked to bypass process          | Follow established process           |

### Red Flags (Wrong Answers)

| Pattern                   | Why It's Wrong                         |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| "It'll save time/money"   | Ethics > Efficiency                    |
| "No one will know"        | Integrity doesn't depend on detection  |
| "It's cultural"           | PMI standards are universal            |
| "The sponsor approved it" | Doesn't make unethical actions ethical |
| "It's just this once"     | Slippery slope; sets bad precedent     |

## 1.4f.7 PMI Disciplinary Process

If a PMP violates the Code of Ethics, PMI can take action:

| Violation Level | Possible Consequences               |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Minor           | Letter of reprimand                 |
| Moderate        | Probation; required ethics training |
| Serious         | Suspension of certification         |
| Severe          | Revocation of certification         |

### How Complaints are Filed
