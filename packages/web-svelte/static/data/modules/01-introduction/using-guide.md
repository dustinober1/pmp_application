## 1.2.1 How This Guide Is Organized

This guide is built to mirror the structure and intent of the new PMP exam, while staying practical for working professionals.

::: info New Section Structure (2026)
The July 2026 exam includes a case-study section, followed by independent questions. The first 5-minute break occurs after the case-study section; the second break occurs about halfway through the independent question portion.
:::

At a high level, the book is organized into 10 logical chapters:

*   **Chapter 01 – Fundamentals & Exam Overview:** The exam, study strategies, and core project management concepts.
*   **Chapter 02 – Strategic Business Management:** Strategy, portfolios, benefits, compliance, and organizational change.
*   **Chapter 03 – Team Leadership & Development:** Building teams, servant leadership, and conflict resolution.
*   **Chapter 04 – Stakeholder & Communication:** Managing stakeholders and communication strategies.
*   **Chapter 05 – Project Initiation:** Starting projects, charters, and business analysis.
*   **Chapter 06 – Project Planning:** Scope, schedule, cost, and resource planning.
*   **Chapter 07 – Risk & Quality Management:** Managing uncertainty, quality standards, and complex environments.
*   **Chapter 08 – Execution & Value Delivery:** Directing work, managing vendors, and delivering value.
*   **Chapter 09 – Project Monitoring, Control & Closure:** Tracking performance, change control, and project closure.
*   **Chapter 10 – AI in Project Management:** Ethics, prompt engineering, and automating project workflows.

### How Chapters Map to the ECO

The PMP exam is built from the Exam Content Outline (ECO). Each ECO task belongs to one of three domains:

*   **People (33%)**: Covered primarily in Chapters 03, 04, and 08.
*   **Process (41%)**: Covered primarily in Chapters 05, 06, 07, 08, and 09.
*   **Business Environment (26%)**: Covered primarily in Chapter 02.

However, remember that these domains overlap. A risk (Process) often involves a stakeholder (People) and impacts strategy (Business Environment).

## 1.2.2 Start by Locating Yourself

Before you dive into detailed study, it helps to answer three questions honestly:

1.  How strong is your current project management experience?
2.  How comfortable are you with exam-style, scenario-based questions?
3.  How much time per week can you realistically dedicate to PMP preparation?

Use the quick self-check below.

### Experience self-check

Put a check next to the statement that best describes you:

- [ ] I have less than 2 years of experience and have rarely led project work myself.
- [ ] I have about 2–3 years of experience and sometimes lead smaller projects or workstreams.
- [ ] I have 3–5+ years of experience and regularly lead projects or major workstreams.

If you checked the first option, you may still benefit from this guide but should treat the PMP itself as a medium-term goal. If you checked the second or third option, you are in the typical experience range for PMP candidates.

### Exam skills self-check

How comfortable are you with standardized, scenario-based exams?

- [ ] Very comfortable – I've done similar exams recently.
- [ ] Somewhat comfortable – it's been a while, but I can adapt.
- [ ] Not comfortable – I find these exams stressful and unfamiliar.

If you checked "Not comfortable," plan to spend extra time on practice questions and review of answer explanations. Exam technique will matter just as much as content knowledge.

### Time availability self-check

On average, how many focused hours per week can you dedicate to PMP prep?

- [ ] 4–6 hours
- [ ] 7–10 hours
- [ ] 11–15 hours
- [ ] More than 15 hours

Use this estimate when selecting your study path in the next section.

## 1.2.3 Choosing a Study Path

## 1.2.4 How to Use This Guide with Other Resources

This guide should not be your only resource. The PMP exam expects you to understand concepts that live across several PMI publications and common industry practices.

### PMBOK Guide and Other PMI Standards

The PMBOK Guide and related PMI standards are invaluable references, but they are not written as exam-prep books. Use them for deeper dives and clarifying terminology.

### Practice Questions and Mock Exams

High-quality practice questions are essential.

**Good habits:**

*   Always review explanations, even for questions you answered correctly.
*   Keep a "mistake log".

::: tip The "Review" Rule
Once you finish a section of the exam and start your break, you cannot go back to those questions. You must complete your review before hitting the break button.
:::

## 1.2.5 Building a Simple Weekly Rhythm

Regardless of which study path you follow, a simple, repeatable weekly rhythm works well.

**Sample Weekly Pattern:**

*   **2–3 Reading Sessions (30–60 mins):** Read one section, take notes.
*   **2 Practice Sessions (30–45 mins):** Do end-of-chapter questions.
*   **1 Review Session (30–45 mins):** Update your tracker, review mistake log.

## 1.2.6 Tracking Your Progress

Use this interactive tracker to monitor your coverage of the domains. You can add new entries as you go, and your progress will be saved in your browser.

<div data-component="ProgressTable"></div>

Every 1–2 weeks, ask yourself: "Which domain have I neglected?"

---

## 1.2.7 When You Are Ready to Schedule the Exam

You are probably close to ready when:

*   You regularly score at or above your target level on full-length practice exams (e.g., consistently near "Target" or 70%+).
*   Your mistake log shows fewer "conceptual misunderstandings" and more "careless reading" errors.
*   You can read a new scenario and quickly articulate the core problem and the PMI-style "best next action".

When these conditions are true, set an exam date within the next 4–6 weeks.

## 1.2.8 Summary
