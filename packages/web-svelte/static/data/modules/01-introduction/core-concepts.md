## The PM Mindset: Integration

Success on the 2026 exam isn't about knowing these concepts in isolation—it's about **Integration**.

- **Scenario**: A risk materializes (1.4d), forcing a change to the scope (1.4b), which triggers a stakeholder concern (1.4a) about quality (1.4c).
- **Action**: A PMP doesn't panic; they use data (1.4e) and ethical conduct (1.4f) to facilitate a transparent resolution.
