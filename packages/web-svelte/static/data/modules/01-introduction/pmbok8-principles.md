## 1. Adopt a Holistic View

**Core Concept**: Projects exist within complex systems. Project managers must understand how their project connects to organizational strategy, other projects, operations, and the broader environment.

### What This Means in Practice

- **Systems Thinking**: Recognize that changing one part of the project affects other parts
- **Strategic Alignment**: Understand how the project supports organizational goals
- **Stakeholder Ecosystem**: Map all relationships, not just direct stakeholders
- **Environmental Awareness**: Consider external factors (market, regulations, technology)
- **Long-term Perspective**: Look beyond project boundaries to lifecycle impact

### Key Behaviors

| Behavior                   | Example                                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Consider interdependencies | Before changing scope, assess impact on schedule, cost, quality, and other projects |
| Balance perspectives       | Weigh strategic, operational, and tactical viewpoints in decisions                  |
| Monitor external factors   | Track regulatory changes, market trends, technology shifts                          |
| Connect to strategy        | Regularly validate project alignment with business objectives                       |

### Exam Application

::: info Exam Pattern
Holistic view questions often present complex scenarios with multiple stakeholders and ask you to identify the BEST approach that considers all perspectives—not just the immediate technical solution.
:::

**Example Scenario**:

> A new feature request would benefit Marketing but impact IT operations. What should the PM do FIRST?
>
> **Best Answer**: Assess the impact across all affected areas and stakeholders before making a decision.

## 2. Focus on Value

**Core Concept**: Projects succeed when they deliver value to stakeholders, not just when they complete on time and budget. Value includes financial returns, customer satisfaction, strategic positioning, learning, and sustainability impact.

### Value Chain Progression

```
Inputs → Outputs → Outcomes → Benefits → Value
         (Deliverables) (Changes)   (Metrics)  (Worth)
```

| Stage       | Definition                  | Who Owns It            |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Output**  | The thing you build         | Project Team           |
| **Outcome** | The change that happens     | Product/Business Owner |
| **Benefit** | The measurable improvement  | Benefits Owner         |
| **Value**   | The overall strategic worth | Organization           |

### Key Behaviors

| Behavior            | Example                                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Define value early  | Establish success criteria and benefits in business case |
| Prioritize by value | Use MoSCoW, WSJF, or value-based prioritization          |
| Measure value       | Track leading indicators of benefit realization          |
| Adapt for value     | Pivot when original outputs won't deliver expected value |

### Types of Value

Don't limit value to financial measures:

| Value Type         | Description                            | Example                    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Financial**      | Revenue, cost savings, ROI             | $500K annual savings       |
| **Strategic**      | Market position, competitive advantage | First-to-market capability |
| **Customer**       | Satisfaction, loyalty, experience      | NPS increase of 20 points  |
| **Organizational** | Capability building, learning          | New skills in AI/ML        |
| **Social**         | Community impact, equity               | Improved accessibility     |
| **Environmental**  | Sustainability gains                   | 30% carbon reduction       |

### Exam Application

::: warning Common Trap
A project that delivers all scope on time and under budget can still be a failure if it doesn't generate the expected value. Look for answers that focus on outcomes and benefits, not just deliverables.

## 3. Embed Quality

**Core Concept**: Quality should be built into processes and deliverables from the start—not inspected in at the end. Prevention is more effective and efficient than detection.

### Prevention vs. Inspection

| Approach       | Philosophy                    | Cost              | Example                                  |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Prevention** | Build it right the first time | Lower total cost  | Code reviews, design standards, training |
| **Inspection** | Find defects after the fact   | Higher total cost | Testing, audits, inspections             |

### Key Behaviors

| Behavior                          | Example                                       |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Establish quality standards early | Define acceptance criteria before work begins |
| Build in quality checkpoints      | Integrate peer reviews, automated testing     |
| Empower team ownership            | Teams responsible for their own quality       |
| Continuous improvement            | Learn from defects to prevent recurrence      |

### Quality in Different Methodologies

| Methodology    | Quality Approach                                         |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Predictive** | Quality Management Plan, inspections, control charts     |
| **Agile**      | Definition of Done, Test-Driven Development, CI/CD       |
| **Hybrid**     | Combine planned quality gates with continuous validation |

### Cost of Quality (COQ)

| Category             | Type            | Examples                               |
| -------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Prevention**       | Conformance     | Training, process design, better tools |
| **Appraisal**        | Conformance     | Testing, inspections, reviews          |
| **Internal Failure** | Non-conformance | Rework, scrap, retesting               |
| **External Failure** | Non-conformance | Warranty, recalls, reputation damage   |

::: tip Exam Insight
The cheapest quality cost is **prevention**. The most expensive is **external failure**. Invest in prevention.

## 4. Be an Accountable Leader

**Core Concept**: Project managers must demonstrate integrity, take responsibility for outcomes, and lead with ethical behavior. This combines stewardship (responsible management) with active leadership.

### Accountability Framework

| Dimension            | Description                      | Example                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Integrity**        | Honest, ethical, transparent     | Report issues accurately; don't hide problems        |
| **Stewardship**      | Responsible resource management  | Protect budget; don't waste organizational resources |
| **Ownership**        | Take responsibility for outcomes | "The buck stops here" mentality                      |
| **Ethical behavior** | Follow PMI Code of Ethics        | Fairness, honesty, responsibility, respect           |

### Key Behaviors

| Behavior                   | Example                                        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Own decisions and outcomes | Don't blame others when things go wrong        |
| Be transparent             | Share status honestly, even when uncomfortable |
| Act ethically              | Report conflicts of interest; refuse bribes    |
| Serve stakeholders         | Balance competing interests fairly             |

### PMI Code of Ethics

The four pillars that inform this principle:

1. **Responsibility**: Own your actions and decisions
2. **Respect**: Treat all stakeholders with dignity
3. **Fairness**: Make impartial, objective decisions
4. **Honesty**: Provide accurate information

### Exam Application

::: info Ethics Questions
Ethics scenarios on the PMP exam often present pressure to cut corners, hide information, or favor one stakeholder over another. The correct answer almost always involves **transparency**, **reporting to appropriate parties**, and **acting in the organization's best interest**.

## 5. Integrate Sustainability

**Core Concept**: Projects should deliver outcomes that balance environmental, social, and economic considerations—the Triple Bottom Line. This is **NEW** in PMBOK 8 and a major 2026 exam topic.

### Triple Bottom Line

| Dimension      | Focus         | Project Considerations                              |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Planet**     | Environmental | Carbon footprint, resource use, waste, biodiversity |
| **People**     | Social        | Labor practices, community impact, DEI, well-being  |
| **Prosperity** | Economic      | Long-term financial viability, local economy        |

### Key Behaviors

| Behavior                      | Example                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Assess sustainability impacts | Conduct P5 or ESG impact assessment       |
| Minimize negative impacts     | Choose low-carbon options; reduce waste   |
| Maximize positive impacts     | Local hiring; community engagement        |
| Report transparently          | Track and disclose sustainability metrics |

### Sustainability Integration Points

| Project Phase  | Sustainability Actions                                    |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Initiation** | Include sustainability goals in business case and charter |
| **Planning**   | Create Sustainability Management Plan; assess P5 impacts  |
| **Execution**  | Green procurement; carbon tracking; waste reduction       |
| **Monitoring** | Track sustainability KPIs; ESG reporting                  |

## 6. Build an Empowered Culture

**Core Concept**: High-performing project teams are built on trust, collaboration, psychological safety, and shared ownership. The project manager's role is to create an environment where people can thrive.

### Elements of Empowered Culture

| Element                  | Description                                  | PM Actions                                     |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Psychological Safety** | People feel safe to take risks and speak up  | Encourage questions; don't punish mistakes     |
| **Trust**                | Team members trust each other and leadership | Be consistent; follow through on commitments   |
| **Collaboration**        | Work together toward shared goals            | Remove silos; facilitate cross-functional work |
| **Autonomy**             | Self-direction within boundaries             | Delegate decisions; avoid micromanagement      |
| **Growth Mindset**       | Continuous learning and improvement          | Encourage experimentation; celebrate learning  |

### Key Behaviors

| Behavior                 | Example                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Create safe environments | Facilitate retrospectives where all voices are heard    |
| Delegate authority       | Let team members make decisions at appropriate level    |
| Support development      | Invest in training and growth opportunities             |
| Recognize contributions  | Celebrate team achievements, not just individual heroes |

### Servant Leadership Connection

Empowered culture aligns with servant leadership:

- **Leader serves the team** (not the other way around)
- **Remove obstacles** so team can focus on work
- **Coach and mentor** rather than command and control
- **Build capability** that lasts beyond the project

### Agile Team Empowerment

| Agile Concept             | Empowerment Connection                        |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Self-organizing teams** | Teams decide how to do the work               |
| **Collective ownership**  | Everyone responsible for quality and outcomes |
| **Servant leader**        | Scrum Master/PM serves and shields the team   |
| **Retrospectives**        | Continuous improvement owned by team          |

::: info Exam Pattern
When scenarios describe team dysfunction (conflict, poor morale, micromanagement), look for answers that address **culture and trust**, not just process fixes. The PM builds the environment; they don't control every detail.

## Applying Principles in Decision Making

When facing a project decision, run it through the principles:

| Principle                      | Question to Ask                                           |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Adopt a Holistic View**      | What are the ripple effects? Who else is impacted?        |
| **Focus on Value**             | Does this decision maximize value delivery?               |
| **Embed Quality**              | Are we preventing problems or just planning to find them? |
| **Be an Accountable Leader**   | Am I being transparent and ethical?                       |
| **Integrate Sustainability**   | What are the environmental and social impacts?            |
| **Build an Empowered Culture** | Does this empower or disempower the team?                 |
