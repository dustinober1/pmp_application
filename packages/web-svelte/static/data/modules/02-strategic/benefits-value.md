# 2.2 Benefits, Value, and Sustainability

**ECO Task**: Evaluate and deliver project benefits and value

Value is the net result of realized benefits minus the costs required to achieve them. In 2026, value includes ethical and sustainable dimensions, not just profit.

## Value Delivery System (How Value Actually Reaches Customers)

Projects create value when deliverables flow through a **value delivery system**:

1. **Idea / Opportunity** → identified through strategy and environmental scanning
2. **Selection** → funded because it supports objectives and benefits
3. **Delivery** → outputs created (product, process, capability)
4. **Adoption** → people use it (change management)
5. **Realization** → benefits measured and sustained (operations ownership)

This is why the PMP exam increasingly rewards **incremental delivery** and early validation: value is discovered and confirmed over time.

## Agile Value: MVP vs. MBI

In Agile, we deliver value in small packages. Know the difference:

- **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**: The smallest thing you can build to **learn** if your hypothesis is true. (Focus: Learning/Risk Reduction).
- **MBI (Minimum Business Increment)**: The smallest piece of value that can be **released** to a customer to generate ROI. (Focus: Value/Revenue).

**Exam Insight**: You might build an internal MVP to test a theory, but you release an MBI to the market to get paid.

## The Value Equation

Traditional PM focused on Scope, Time, and Cost. The modern PM focuses on the **Triple Bottom Line**:

<div class="value-grid">
  <div class="value-card profit">
    <div class="value-title">Profit</div>
    <p>Does the project make financial sense? (ROI, NPV, Cost Savings).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="value-card people">
    <div class="value-title">People</div>
    <p>Does it improve lives for the community and employees? (Social Impact).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="value-card planet">
    <div class="value-title">Planet</div>
    <p>Is it environmentally sustainable? (Carbon footprint, Waste reduction).</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Benefits Realization

Value isn't usually realized until _after_ the project ends. BRM bridges that gap.

1.  **Identify**: Define the metric upfront (e.g., "Reduce processing time by 20%").
2.  **Execute**: Focus the team on features that drive that metric.
3.  **Sustain**: Hand over the "Benefits Plan" to operations so they can track it long-term.

::: tip The Benefits Owner
A critical role. This is the business person (not the PM) who is responsible for ensuring the deliverables actually generate revenue/savings after the project closes.

## Financial Value (Fast Exam Reference)

- **ROI**: (Benefits − Costs) / Costs. Higher is better.
- **NPV**: Present value of future cash flows minus initial investment. Positive NPV is usually desirable.
- **Payback period**: How fast you recover the investment. Shorter is usually preferred.

::: info Reminder
Financial metrics help compare options, but **compliance, safety, and ethics can override** them.

## ESG: Integration, Not Add-on

In 2026, ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) is a **constraint**.

- **Environmental**: Choosing a "Green" cloud provider or reducing material waste.
- **Social**: Ensuring fair wages in the supply chain.
- **Governance**: Strict adherence to anti-corruption laws.

### Where ESG Gets “Baked In”

- **Requirements and acceptance criteria** (what must be true at delivery)
- **Procurement criteria** (vendor due diligence, ethical sourcing)
- **Design decisions** (energy usage, data minimization, accessibility)
- **Reporting** (how the organization proves compliance)

<div class="study-tip">
  <strong>Exam Insight:</strong> If a stakeholder suggests a cheaper vendor who has a history of human rights violations, the PM must **reject** the vendor based on the organization's ESG/Code of Ethics policy. Profit does not trump ethics on the PMP exam.
