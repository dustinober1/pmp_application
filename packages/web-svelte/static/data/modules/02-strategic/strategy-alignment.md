# 2.1 Strategic Alignment

**ECO Task**: Assess project alignment with organizational strategy

Strategic alignment is the discipline of ensuring that the **right work** gets done in the first place and stays relevant as the business environment shifts.

## 🎯 What Strategic Alignment Means (On the PMP Exam)
On the exam, “strategic alignment” is not a slogan. It is a **decision filter** you use every time you:

*   Approve, reject, or re-prioritize work
*   Recommend a scope change (or *refuse* one)
*   Escalate a major risk or regulatory change
*   Recommend a project be paused or closed because the expected value is gone

::: tip 💡 The PMI Mindset
If a project is “green” (on time/budget) but is no longer valuable or compliant, it is **not successful**. The right answer is usually: **raise it to governance and recommend a strategic decision**.

## 🧰 The Alignment Toolkit (Artifacts You Must Recognize)
These artifacts show up in exam questions as clues for *where you are* in the lifecycle and *who decides what*.

| Artifact                       | What it answers                       | Owned by (primary)       | Used when                       |
| :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| **Business Case**              | “Should we invest, and why?”           | Sponsor / Business       | Selection & funding decisions   |
| **Project Charter**            | “Are we authorized to start?”          | Sponsor (authorizes) / PM (uses) | Initiating; formal start        |
| **Benefits Realization Plan**  | “How will value be measured and sustained?” | Benefits Owner / Business | Planning through sustainment    |
| **Roadmap** (Product/Program)  | “What outcomes come when?”             | Product Owner / Program  | Coordinating delivery & dependencies |
| **KPIs / OKRs**                | “How do we know we are winning?”       | Business leadership      | Ongoing value validation        |
| **Governance Reviews**         | “Continue, pivot, pause, or stop?”     | Steering committee / Portfolio | Stage gates / periodic reviews  |

## 2026 Focus: Continuous Validation
Strategic alignment is not a "set it and forget it" activity.
*   **Pivot or Persevere**: Having the courage to recommend project cancellation if the strategic value evaporates.
*   **PESTLE Scanning**: Watching the horizon (Political, Economic, Social) for shifts that impact project viability.

## 🔁 The Continuous Alignment Loop (A Simple Decision Model)
Use this when an exam question introduces “new information” mid-project (market shift, regulatory change, leadership pivot).

1.  **Detect**: Identify the change (signal, trigger, new constraint).
2.  **Assess**: Evaluate impacts to scope/cost/schedule *and* value/benefits.
3.  **Escalate**: Bring options to governance (continue, pivot, pause, stop).
4.  **Decide**: Governance chooses; the PM executes the decision.
5.  **Update**: Update baselines, risks, and communications; reinforce adoption.

::: warning 🚦 Common Trap
Do not “self-cancel” a project unless you have explicit authority. The PMI-aligned move is to **recommend** cancellation and support an orderly closure.
