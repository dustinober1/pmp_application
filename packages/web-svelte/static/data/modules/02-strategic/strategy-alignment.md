# 2.1 Strategic Alignment

**ECO Task**: Assess project alignment with organizational strategy

Strategic alignment is the discipline of ensuring that the **right work** gets done in the first place and stays relevant as the business environment shifts.

## What Strategic Alignment Means (On the PMP Exam)

On the exam, “strategic alignment” is not a slogan. It is a **decision filter** you use every time you:

- Approve, reject, or re-prioritize work
- Recommend a scope change (or _refuse_ one)
- Escalate a major risk or regulatory change
- Recommend a project be paused or closed because the expected value is gone

::: tip The PMI Mindset
If a project is “green” (on time/budget) but is no longer valuable or compliant, it is **not successful**. The right answer is usually: **raise it to governance and recommend a strategic decision**.

## The Strategic Hierarchy

Great project management connects daily execution to organizational objectives.

## The Alignment Toolkit (Artifacts You Must Recognize)

These artifacts show up in exam questions as clues for _where you are_ in the lifecycle and _who decides what_.

| Artifact                      | What it answers                             | Owned by (primary)               | Used when                            |
| :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **Business Case**             | “Should we invest, and why?”                | Sponsor / Business               | Selection & funding decisions        |
| **Project Charter**           | “Are we authorized to start?”               | Sponsor (authorizes) / PM (uses) | Initiating; formal start             |
| **Benefits Realization Plan** | “How will value be measured and sustained?” | Benefits Owner / Business        | Planning through sustainment         |
| **Roadmap** (Product/Program) | “What outcomes come when?”                  | Product Owner / Program          | Coordinating delivery & dependencies |
| **KPIs / OKRs**               | “How do we know we are winning?”            | Business leadership              | Ongoing value validation             |
| **Governance Reviews**        | “Continue, pivot, pause, or stop?”          | Steering committee / Portfolio   | Stage gates / periodic reviews       |

## 2026 Focus: Continuous Validation

Strategic alignment is not a "set it and forget it" activity.

- **Pivot or Persevere**: Having the courage to recommend project cancellation if the strategic value evaporates.
- **PESTLE Scanning**: Watching the horizon (Political, Economic, Social) for shifts that impact project viability.

---

## The Continuous Alignment Loop (A Simple Decision Model)

Use this when an exam question introduces “new information” mid-project (market shift, regulatory change, leadership pivot).

1. **Detect**: Identify the change (signal, trigger, new constraint).
2. **Assess**: Evaluate impacts to scope/cost/schedule _and_ value/benefits.
3. **Escalate**: Bring options to governance (continue, pivot, pause, stop).
4. **Decide**: Governance chooses; the PM executes the decision.
5. **Update**: Update baselines, risks, and communications; reinforce adoption.

::: warning Common Trap
Do not “self-cancel” a project unless you have explicit authority. The PMI-aligned move is to **recommend** cancellation and support an orderly closure.
