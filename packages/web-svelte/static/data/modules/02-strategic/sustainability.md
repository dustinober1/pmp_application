# 2.2 Sustainability in Project Management

**ECO Task**: Evaluate and deliver project benefits and value (with a sustainability lens)

In 2026, sustainability is no longer a niche concern but an integrated aspect of project success. It means considering the environmental, social, and economic impacts of a project throughout its lifecycle.

## The Triple Bottom Line (TBL)

The Triple Bottom Line expands the traditional single bottom line (profit) to include social and environmental considerations. Projects should strive to deliver value across all three dimensions:

* **Profit (Economic)**: Financial viability, cost-effectiveness, economic growth, and long-term economic prosperity for the organization and stakeholders.
 * *Project Examples*: ROI, NPV, cost savings, revenue generation.
* **People (Social)**: Impact on human capital, communities, labor practices, diversity, equity, and inclusion, health, and safety.
 * *Project Examples*: Ethical sourcing, fair wages, community engagement, safe working conditions, employee well-being.
* **Planet (Environmental)**: Impact on natural resources, ecosystems, pollution, climate change, and resource depletion.
 * *Project Examples*: Reduced carbon footprint, waste reduction, sustainable material usage, energy efficiency, biodiversity protection.

::: info Exam Insight
When faced with a decision that involves a trade-off between profit and people/planet, the PMI-aligned answer will often prioritize people and planet (ethics, safety, and sustainability) over pure financial gain, especially if the financial gain comes at an unsustainable cost.

## ESG Factors (Environmental, Social, Governance)

ESG criteria are a set of standards for a company's operations that investors increasingly use to screen potential investments. Project managers need to understand how their projects contribute to or impact these factors.

* **Environmental**: Climate change, resource depletion, waste, pollution, deforestation.
 * *Project Manager Role*: Consider sustainable design, energy-efficient solutions, waste management plans, responsible sourcing.
* **Social**: Working conditions, local communities, health and safety, employee relations, diversity, data privacy.
 * *Project Manager Role*: Ensure ethical labor practices, engage local communities, implement robust health and safety protocols, protect stakeholder data.
* **Governance**: Board structure, executive compensation, audits, internal controls, shareholder rights, bribery and corruption.
 * *Project Manager Role*: Adhere to transparent reporting, ensure ethical conduct, comply with anti-corruption laws, implement sound project governance.

### Integrating ESG into Project Management

* **Project Selection**: ESG considerations can be part of the weighted scoring model for project selection.
* **Requirements**: Incorporate ESG-related requirements (e.g., "must use 50% recycled materials," "must be carbon neutral").
* **Risk Management**: Identify and manage ESG-related risks (e.g., reputational damage from unsustainable practices, regulatory non-compliance).
* **Procurement**: Evaluate suppliers based on their ESG performance and sustainable practices.
* **Reporting**: Track and report on the project's ESG performance and contribution to organizational sustainability goals.

## Circular Economy Principles

Moving away from a linear "take-make-dispose" model, projects can contribute to a circular economy.

* **Reduce**: Minimize waste generation, consumption of resources.
* **Reuse**: Design for durability and multiple uses.
* **Recycle**: Facilitate the recycling of materials at the end of a product's life.
* **Repair**: Design products that can be easily repaired.
* **Refurbish**: Restore older products to a like-new condition.

*Project Manager Role*: Encourage design choices that support these principles, work with supply chain to source reusable/recycled materials, plan for end-of-life management of project deliverables.

## Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a collection of 17 interlinked global goals designed to be a "blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all." Projects can align with these goals.

* *Project Manager Role*: Understand which SDGs the organization aims to support and align project objectives and outcomes accordingly. (e.g., a project providing clean water aligns with SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation).

## Practical Application in Projects

* **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)**: A tool to evaluate the environmental impacts of a product, process, or system throughout its life cycle.
* **Green Project Management**: Integrating environmental considerations into all phases of the project lifecycle.
* **Social Impact Assessment (SIA)**: Evaluating the social consequences of a project (both positive and negative) for people and communities.

::: tip Exam Scenario
If a project is deemed financially profitable but has significant negative environmental or social impacts, the PMI-aligned project manager should **escalate** these concerns to governance, provide options, and advocate for decisions that balance the Triple Bottom Line, even if it impacts the project's profitability or schedule.
