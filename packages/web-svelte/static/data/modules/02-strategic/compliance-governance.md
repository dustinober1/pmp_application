# 2.3 Compliance & Governance

Projects operate within a web of "Unwritten Rules" (Politics) and "Written Laws" (Compliance). The 2026 PMP Exam tests your ability to navigate both without crashing.

## Compliance vs. Standards vs. Policy (Know the Difference)

Understanding the hierarchy of rules is critical for exam success:

- **Laws & Regulations**: External, mandatory, non-negotiable. Failure results in legal penalties. Examples include GDPR, SOX, OSHA, HIPAA, Building Codes, and Environmental Laws.
- **Industry Standards**: Agreed minimum practices that may be optional until adopted by contract or regulation. Examples include ISO 27001, IEEE, PMBOK, ITIL, and NIST Cybersecurity Framework.
- **Organizational Policy**: Internal rules enforceable within the organization. Examples include procurement thresholds, approval paths, code of conduct, and travel policy.
- **Guidelines & Best Practices**: Recommended approaches that are optional but wise to follow. Examples include team conventions, style guides, and suggested templates.

**Priority Rule**: On the exam, when these conflict, laws and safety always win. You cannot trade safety or legality for schedule or cost.

## The Compliance Radar

Compliance failures are business threats, not just risks.

- **Data Privacy**: Regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA require consent for handling customer data. Penalties can be up to 4% of annual revenue (GDPR).
- **EHS (Environmental, Health, and Safety)**: Regulations like OSHA and ISO 14001 are non-negotiable. Safety takes precedence over schedule. Penalties can include criminal liability and project shutdown.
- **Financial**: Regulations such as SOX, AML, and FCPA focus on anti-bribery and accurate financial reporting. Penalties can include executive imprisonment and massive fines.
- **Codes**: Building, Cyber, and Accessibility codes dictate minimum quality and safety. Penalties can result in inability to deploy/occupy and required rework.

**Key Regulations Reference Table**: Provides details on GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, HIPAA, SOX, OSHA, ADA, and FCPA, including their focus area, key requirements, and penalties.

**Retroactive Rule**: If a new law is passed during your project, you must adopt it, even if it impacts your baseline. A project cannot be successful if it is illegal.

## Governance vs. Management

- **Governance (Steering Committee)**: Sets the direction (e.g., "We are going North."). Can cancel the project or approve budget increases.
- **Management (Project Manager)**: Executes the direction (e.g., "Here is the map to get North."). Manages the team and budget within approved tolerance.

**Governance Decision Matrix**: Outlines authority levels for different decision types, from strategic direction (Steering Committee) to day-to-day execution (Project Manager).

## Agile Governance (Adaptive Oversight)

Governance in Agile changes shape but does not disappear.

- **Traditional vs. Agile Governance**: Compares review mechanisms, what's reviewed, evidence of progress, decision timing, and adaptation between traditional and agile approaches.
- **Agile Governance Principles**: Includes System Demos and Retrospectives instead of phase gates, governing against Product Vision and Roadmap, empirical control, and trust-based teams.

**Hybrid Truth**: Most organizations use a hybrid approach, combining strategic milestones with iterative delivery.

## Who Does What? (Governance Bodies You'll See in Questions)

- **Sponsor**: Provides funding, champions the project, removes political obstacles, and is the final escalation point.
- **Steering Committee**: Makes strategic decisions (continue/pivot/stop), major funding decisions, and resolves cross-project priority conflicts.
- **PMO (Project Management Office)**: Enforces processes, supports governance, provides templates, and offers methodology guidance.
- **CCB (Change Control Board)**: Approves/rejects change requests and protects scope, schedule, and cost baselines.
- **Legal / Compliance**: Provides regulatory interpretation, audits compliance, handles escalations, and reviews contracts.

**Exam Shortcut**: If the decision is about strategy or funding, think "steering committee / portfolio." If it is about baseline change, think "change control." If you need process or templates, think "PMO."

## The Ethical Compass

PMI mandates four core values: Responsibility, Respect, Fairness, and Honesty.

- **The Four Values in Action**: Explains what each value means and provides exam scenario examples.
- **Ethical Scenarios (Exam Favorites)**: Covers conflict of interest, bribery/gifts, status reporting, and safety violations, outlining the wrong and right actions.
- **Bribery and Facilitation Payments**: Differentiates between bribery (absolutely prohibited), facilitation payments (prohibited by PMI ethics), legitimate gifts (may be acceptable), and entertainment (check organizational limits).

**Zero Tolerance**: PMI has zero tolerance for bribery, including facilitation payments.

## Data Privacy & AI (Common 2026 Exam Theme)

If your project collects or uses personal data (especially for AI training), exam-safe behaviors include:

- **The 5 Principles of Data Privacy**: Minimize data collection, obtain explicit consent, secure data, establish retention policies, and document traceability.
- **AI-Specific Considerations**: Includes training data consent, model explainability, bias testing, data residency, and the right to be forgotten.
