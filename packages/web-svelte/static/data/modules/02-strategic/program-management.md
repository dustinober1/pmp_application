# 2.1c Program Management

**ECO Task**: Determine appropriate project methodology/methods, and practices

Program Management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to a program to meet the program requirements and to obtain benefits and control not available by managing projects individually.

## Programs vs. Projects (Refresher)

- **Project**: A temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. Focuses on producing specific deliverables (outputs).
- **Program**: A group of related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits not available from managing them individually. Focuses on benefit realization and strategic ROI.

## Key Program Artifacts

- **Program Charter**: Similar to a project charter but for the entire program. Authorizes the program, defines its purpose, strategic alignment, and expected benefits.
- **Program Roadmap**: A high-level, long-term plan showing how various projects and activities within the program will contribute to achieving the program's strategic objectives and benefits over time.
- **Adaptive Roadmaps**: In agile environments, roadmaps are typically adaptive and evolve as new information and feedback are gathered. They focus on themes and features rather than fixed dates and detailed scope.
- **Program Management Plan**: Details how the program will be executed, monitored, controlled, and closed, including how its components will be coordinated.

## Program Governance

Program governance provides the framework within which program decisions are made, ensuring that the program adheres to organizational policies and strategies.

- **Program Steering Committee**: Often oversees the program, providing strategic guidance, resolving high-level issues, and approving major changes.
- **Benefit Realization Management**: A key focus of program management, ensuring that the intended benefits are identified, tracked, and delivered.
- **Change Control**: While individual projects have their change control, the program often has a higher-level change control process to manage changes that impact the program's overall objectives or multiple projects within it.

## Managing Interdependencies

One of the primary responsibilities of a Program Manager is to manage interdependencies among the projects within the program.

- **Resource Dependencies**: Projects within a program often share resources, requiring careful allocation and prioritization by the Program Manager.
- **Outcome Dependencies**: The output of one project may be a prerequisite for another, necessitating careful sequencing and coordination.
- **Stakeholder Dependencies**: Managing stakeholders across multiple projects and ensuring consistent communication and expectation management.

## Advice for Project Leaders within a Program

If your project is part of a larger program:

- **Think Globally**: Understand how your project contributes to the overall program benefits.
- **Communicate Constantly**: Maintain open lines of communication with the Program Manager and other Project Managers within the program.
- **Manage Interfaces**: Actively manage dependencies and interfaces with other projects.
- **Escalate Appropriately**: Raise issues that impact program-level objectives or multiple projects to the Program Manager. Do not try to solve program-level conflicts at the project level.

::: info Exam Tip
If a question involves coordinating multiple, related projects to achieve overarching benefits, it's a Program Management scenario. The Program Manager is focused on benefits, not just individual project deliverables.
