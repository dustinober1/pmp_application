# 2.1c Project & Program Alignment

**ECO Task**: Demonstrate an understanding of how projects fit within programs and portfolios

Projects rarely exist in a vacuum. They are often components of larger programs, which in turn support strategic portfolios. **Alignment** ensures that individual projects contribute coherently to the same outcomes and benefits.

---

## Program as an Alignment Mechanism

Programs group related projects (and other work) to achieve benefits that are not available by managing them individually. This coordination inherently drives alignment.

* **Silo Breaking**: Programs naturally force cross-functional collaboration and communication between projects that might otherwise operate in isolation.
* **Dependency Management**: Programs identify and manage dependencies between projects (e.g., Project A's output is Project B's input).
* **Resource Optimization**: Programs can optimize shared resources across multiple projects, preventing conflicts and maximizing utilization.
* **Benefits Realization**: The primary goal of a program is to realize collective benefits from its component projects that are aligned to strategic objectives.

## Common Alignment Mechanisms

* **Program Roadmap**: A high-level view that shows the planned sequence of projects and deliverables within a program, ensuring all components are moving towards the same strategic goals.
* **Benefits Map**: A visual representation linking project outputs to program outcomes and strategic benefits.
* **Integrated Change Control**: Changes impacting multiple projects within a program are reviewed at the program level to ensure overall alignment is maintained.
* **Regular Program Reviews**: Periodic meetings where project managers report progress to the Program Manager and Steering Committee, ensuring alignment and addressing deviations.

## Managing Dependencies (Exam Favorite)

Dependencies are critical for alignment. Unmanaged dependencies are a frequent cause of project and program failure.

### Types of Dependencies

1. **Finish-to-Start (FS)**: The most common. Activity B cannot start until Activity A finishes. (e.g., Testing cannot start until Coding is finished).
2. **Start-to-Start (SS)**: Activity B cannot start until Activity A starts. (e.g., Pouring concrete cannot start until formwork installation starts).
3. **Finish-to-Finish (FF)**: Activity B cannot finish until Activity A finishes. (e.g., Documentation cannot finish until testing finishes).
4. **Start-to-Finish (SF)**: Activity B cannot finish until Activity A starts. (Rare).

### Dependency Contexts in Programs

* **Internal Dependencies**: Between tasks or projects managed by the same organization.
* **External Dependencies**: Involving external entities like vendors, regulators, or other organizations.
* **Discretionary Dependencies**: Based on best practices or preferred sequences, often soft logic.
* **Mandatory Dependencies**: Legally or contractually required, or inherent in the nature of the work (hard logic).

### Common Dependency Failure Modes & PMI-Aligned Responses

| Failure Mode | PMI-Aligned Response |
| :----------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project A delays, impacting Project B** | PM B contacts PM A for peer-to-peer resolution FIRST. If unresolved, escalate to Program Manager. |
| **Shared resource (e.g., security architect) is over-allocated across projects** | Program Manager (or PMO) re-prioritizes work or secures additional resources. |
| **Regulatory approval is needed before next phase** | Project/Program Manager proactively engages legal/regulatory team; builds contingency. |
| **Product from one project doesn't meet needs of another** | Early and continuous integration; joint testing; clearly defined interface agreements. |

## Alignment in Different Methodologies

* **Agile (Scaled)**: Frameworks like SAFe, LeSS, or Scrum@Scale ensure alignment by using common backlogs, synchronized iterations, and clear portfolio/program objectives. Frequent integration and demos maintain alignment.
* **Predictive**: Detailed planning, integrated schedules, and strict change control ensure projects stay aligned to the master program plan.
* **Hybrid**: Combines elements. For example, a program roadmap (predictive) guides multiple agile projects (adaptive), with integrated reviews.

::: info Exam Tip
When a question describes projects that need to be coordinated for overarching benefits, think **program management**. If it's about optimizing resource allocation or making strategic investment decisions across multiple programs and projects, think **portfolio management**.
