# 2.1b Portfolio Management

**ECO Task**: Demonstrate an understanding of how projects fit within programs and portfolios

While Project Management is about "Doing things right," **Portfolio Management** is about **"Doing the right things."** It is the centralized management of projects to achieve strategic objectives.

## What a Portfolio Actually Includes
A portfolio can include:
* **Projects** (temporary work with defined outcomes)
* **Programs** (coordinated projects for benefits and synergy)
* **Operational work** (ongoing “run the business” investments)

Portfolio management focuses on **investment decisions**: start, stop, pause, accelerate, re-scope, or re-fund.

## The Hierarchy of Work
Understanding the distinction is vital for the exam.

**Portfolio**
* **Focus**: Strategic Value
* **Scope**: The entire enterprise
* **Success**: Aggregate investment performance

**Program**
* **Focus**: Related Benefits
* **Scope**: A group of projects
* **Success**: Benefits Realization

**Project**
* **Focus**: Specific Output
* **Scope**: Defined Scope Statement
* **Success**: Time, Cost, Quality

## Portfolio Governance (How Decisions Get Made)
Most organizations run a repeatable portfolio cycle:

1. **Intake**: Ideas enter via a request, business case, or strategic initiative.
2. **Evaluate**: Compare options using financial + non-financial criteria.
3. **Prioritize**: Rank work against strategy, capacity, and risk appetite.
4. **Authorize**: Approve funding and formally start (charter/authorization).
5. **Monitor**: Review performance and benefits; manage interdependencies.
6. **Rebalance**: Reallocate budget/people when strategy or constraints change.
7. **Retire**: Stop low-value work and close projects cleanly.

**Exam Clue**: If the question mentions “re-prioritizing the portfolio” or “reallocating resources across projects,” you are in **portfolio** territory, not project-level change control.

## Portfolio Balancing
A healthy portfolio is a balanced mix of investments.

* **Transform**: High-risk, high-reward "Moonshots" that create new markets.
* **Grow**: Medium-risk enhancements to expand existing products.
* **Run**: Low-risk operational maintenance (Keep the lights on).

## Common Portfolio Prioritization Criteria (What Gets Weighted)

| Criterion | What it means | Example |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| **Strategic fit** | Direct contribution to objectives | Supports “expand into EU market” |
| **Value / benefits** | Expected measurable outcome | Cost reduction, revenue lift |
| **Risk** | Uncertainty and downside exposure | New tech, regulatory uncertainty |
| **Time criticality** | Deadlines and market windows | Compliance deadline in 90 days |
| **Capacity** | Skills and availability | Only 2 security engineers exist |
| **Dependencies** | Blockers and sequencing | Needs platform migration first |
| **ESG / ethics** | Sustainability and conduct constraints | Vendor due diligence issues |

## Resource Capacity
The hardest part of portfolio management is the **Resource Constraint**.
* **WIP Limits**: Reducing the number of active projects to prevent "Resource Peanut-Butter" (spreading people so thin they perform poorly everywhere).
* **Bottlenecks**: Identifying scarce skills (e.g., Security Architects) that throttle the entire portfolio.

## Portfolio Health Signals (What Leaders Watch)
* **Value delivery vs plan** (benefits realized, not just milestones hit)
* **Throughput** (how many initiatives finish vs start)
* **Resource utilization vs burnout risk**
* **Risk exposure** across the whole investment mix
* **Alignment drift** (projects that no longer map to objectives)

** Exam Insight:** If your project is "Green" (on time/budget) but the Portfolio Manager asks to cancel it, do not argue. The strategy may have shifted, making your project irrelevant. Your role is to execute an orderly administrative closure.
