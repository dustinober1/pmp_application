# 2.4 Organizational Change

**ECO Task**: Support organizational change

"Technology projects don't fail because of technology—they fail because people don't adopt the change." This is the core principle of **Organizational Change Management (OCM)**.

---

## 🧭 The PMP Mindset: Adoption Is Part of "Done"
If the project delivers the tool but nobody uses it, value is not realized. PMI expects you to plan for:
*   **Readiness** (are people prepared?)
*   **Adoption** (are people actually using it?)
*   **Sustainment** (will the behavior stick?)

## 👥 The Adoption Gap
The chasm between "Output" and "Outcome" is human adoption.

| The Deliverable (Output) | The Human Reality (Risk)                               | The OCM Solution                                        |
| :----------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| **New CRM System**       | Sales Reps stick to Excel because it's familiar.        | Early "Champion" program to build advocacy.              |
| **New AI Coding Tool**   | Developers fear job loss and sabotage implementation. | Transparent communication on job security + re-skilling. |
| **New Safety Protocol**  | Workers ignore it because it slows them down.           | "WIIFM" (What's in it for me) safety bonuses.            |
| **New Expense System**   | Employees find workarounds to avoid the new process.    | Management enforcement + process redesign.               |
| **New Collaboration Tool** | Teams continue using email and old tools.             | Executive role modeling + remove old tool access.        |

## 🪜 Change Frameworks
You must know the language of change dynamics.

### ADKAR
*   **Awareness**: "I know why we must change" → *Communication*
*   **Desire**: "I want to participate and support" → *Motivation/WIIFM*
*   **Knowledge**: "I know how to change" → *Training*
*   **Ability**: "I can implement the change" → *Practice/Support*
*   **Reinforcement**: "I will sustain the change" → *Recognition/Incentives*
**Use when:** Diagnosing why individuals resist change

### Kotter's 8 Steps
1.  **Urgency:** Create a sense of urgency
2.  **Coalition:** Build a guiding coalition
3.  **Vision:** Form a strategic vision
4.  **Army:** Enlist a volunteer army
5.  **Enable:** Enable action by removing barriers
6.  **Wins:** Generate short-term wins
7.  **Sustain:** Sustain acceleration
8.  **Anchor:** Institute change in culture
**Use when:** Planning organization-wide transformation

### Lewin's Model
*   🧊 **Unfreeze:** Break the status quo—people recognize the need for change
*   🌊 **Change:** The transition state—new ways are learned and practiced
*   ❄️ **Refreeze:** Lock in the new state—stabilize and reinforce new behaviors
**Use when:** Understanding the overall change journey

### 📊 Framework Comparison

| Framework         | Focus      | Best For                                     | Key Question It Answers         |
| :---------------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| **ADKAR**         | Individual | Diagnosing resistance; targeted interventions | "Why isn't this person changing?" |
| **Kotter's 8 Steps** | Organization | Large-scale transformation planning          | "How do we change the whole organization?" |
| **Lewin's Model** | Process    | Understanding change phases                  | "What stage of change are we in?" |

## 📋 ADKAR Deep Dive (Exam Favorite)

ADKAR is the most commonly tested change framework. Understanding each element helps you diagnose and address resistance.

*   **Awareness**: "Does the person understand WHY we need to change?"
    *   Barrier Signs: "I didn't know we were changing" / "Why fix what isn't broken?"
    *   Intervention: Communications campaign; leadership messages; burning platform
*   **Desire**: "Does the person WANT to participate?"
    *   Barrier Signs: "I know why, but I don't want to" / Hidden resistance / Foot-dragging
    *   Intervention: WIIFM messaging; address fears; involve in design; incentives
*   **Knowledge**: "Does the person know HOW to change?"
    *   Barrier Signs: "I want to, but I don't know how" / Confusion / Errors
    *   Intervention: Training programs; documentation; job aids; mentoring
*   **Ability**: "CAN the person perform the new behavior?"
    *   Barrier Signs: "I know how, but I can't do it well" / Slow performance / Frustration
    *   Intervention: Coaching; practice time; reduced workload during transition; support desk
*   **Reinforcement**: "Will the person SUSTAIN the change over time?"
    *   Barrier Signs: Reverting to old ways / "Just this once" / Gradual regression
    *   Intervention: Recognition programs; performance metrics; remove old options; celebrate wins

::: tip 💡 ADKAR Diagnosis Shortcut
If training is excellent but adoption is still low, you usually have a **Desire** problem (motivation, fear, incentives), not a Knowledge problem. Training solves K and A, but it cannot solve D.

## 📄 The Change Management Plan (What It Typically Contains)
In practice (and on the exam), change is supported by a set of coordinated plans:

### Change Management Plan Components

| Component                   | Purpose                                     | Key Elements                                |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------ |
| **Change Impact Assessment** | Who is impacted and how                     | Stakeholder groups; impact severity; timing |
| **Stakeholder Engagement**  | Messages, channels, cadence                 | Target audiences; key messages; communication schedule |
| **Training Plan**           | Learning paths and support                  | Training formats; schedule; assessment; certification |
| **Champion Network**        | Local advocates                             | Champion selection; training; responsibilities |
| **Resistance Management**   | How feedback is captured and acted on       | Escalation paths; intervention strategies   |
| **Adoption Metrics**        | How you measure readiness and usage         | Leading/lagging indicators; targets; reporting |
| **Sustainment Plan**        | Long-term support model                     | Ongoing training; help desk; process integration |

### 📈 Example Adoption Metrics

| Metric                  | Type                | Why It Matters                   | Example Target          |
| :---------------------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| **Training Completion** | Leading (Readiness) | Shows people are prepared        | 95% complete before go-live |
| **Active Usage**        | Lagging (Adoption)  | Shows people are using the system | 80% weekly active users by week 4 |
| **Process Compliance**  | Lagging (Behavior)  | Shows process change             | 90% of requests in new system |
| **Support Ticket Trend** | Lagging (Friction)  | Shows ease of use                | Tickets decrease by 50% after week 4 |
| **User Satisfaction (NPS)** | Lagging (Experience) | Shows acceptance                 | NPS > 20 by month 3       |
| **Error Rate**          | Lagging (Quality)   | Shows proper use                 | Errors < 5% by month 2    |

## 🛑 Managing Resistance
Resistance is a natural reaction to fear. Do not punish it; manage it.

### Understanding Resistance

*   **Can't Do It** (Knowledge/Ability Gap): Person lacks skills or resources to change. Solution: Training, coaching, tools, support.
*   **Won't Do It** (Desire Gap): Person doesn't want to change; fears or opposes. Solution: WIIFM, addressing fears, incentives, management reinforcement.
*   **Don't Get It** (Awareness Gap): Person doesn't understand why change is needed. Solution: Communication, leadership messaging, burning platform.

### 🎯 WIIFM (What's In It For Me?)
Communicate the benefits to *them*, not just the company.

| Change              | Company Benefit         | WIIFM Message                                              |
| :------------------ | :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| New CRM             | Better sales tracking   | "You'll have customer history at your fingertips—no more hunting for info" |
| Expense System      | Faster processing       | "Get reimbursed in 3 days instead of 3 weeks"              |
| AI Tool             | Productivity gains      | "AI handles the tedious parts so you can focus on creative work" |
| Safety Protocol     | Fewer accidents         | "Go home safely every day to your family"                  |

### 🚦 Change Saturation

*   **Saturation Check**: If the org is undergoing 5 changes simultaneously, adding a 6th will fail regardless of quality
*   The strategic move is to **Delay** or **Sequence** changes
*   Consider a "change portfolio" approach—prioritize and pace changes just like project portfolio management

---

## 🧬 Culture vs. Strategy
Peter Drucker famously said, *"Culture eats strategy for breakfast."*

*   **Culture**: The shared values and "unwritten rules" of the organization (e.g., "We value speed over perfection" or "We never deliver bad news upwards")
*   **Strategy**: The plan to achieve goals

### Cultural Compatibility Matrix

| Culture Type     | Compatible Changes                | Incompatible Changes             | PM Approach                    |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| **Risk-Averse**  | Incremental improvements; proven solutions | Bleeding-edge innovation; fail-fast | Emphasize testing; pilot programs |
| **Hierarchical** | Top-down mandates; clear roles    | Self-organizing teams; empowerment | Executive sponsorship critical |
| **Innovative**   | New technology; experimentation   | Standardization; rigid processes | Frame as continuous improvement |
| **Collaborative** | Team-based decisions; consensus   | Unilateral changes; top-down edicts | Involve stakeholders; co-create |

::: warning 📊 Exam Insight
If your project strategy conflicts with the culture (e.g., trying to implement "Fail Fast" Agile in a culture that punishes all errors), the project will fail unless you address the culture first. You cannot install a tool that violates the culture.

## 🔄 Agile Change Management
In predictive projects, change is often a "Big Bang" at the end. In Agile, change is **iterative**:

### Agile vs. Predictive Change Management

| Aspect                 | Predictive (Big Bang)       | Agile (Iterative)                    |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **Timing**             | Change at the end           | Continuous small changes             |
| **User Involvement**   | Requirements phase; UAT     | Every sprint demo; continuous feedback |
| **Resistance Detection** | Late (at go-live)           | Early (at each iteration)            |
| **Adjustments**        | Difficult; change control   | Built-in; backlog reprioritization   |
| **Training**           | Single training event       | Progressive learning; learning by doing |

### Agile Change Principles

*   **Continuous Feedback**: Users see the tool every 2 weeks, so resistance is caught early
*   **Co-Creation**: Stakeholders help build the solution, so "Desire" (from ADKAR) is built-in
*   **Minimal Viable Change**: Introduce small shifts incrementally rather than one massive shock
*   **Demo-Based Buy-In**: Showing working software builds confidence and reduces fear

## 🏆 Change Champion Networks

### What Champions Do

| Champion Activity | Purpose                           | Impact                    |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------- | :------------------------ |
| **Advocate**      | Promote the change locally        | Builds grassroots support |
| **Translate**     | Explain "corporate speak" in local terms | Increases understanding   |
| **Listen**        | Gather and report concerns        | Early warning system for resistance |
| **Model**         | Demonstrate new behaviors         | Peer influence            |
| **Support**       | First line of help for colleagues | Reduces help desk load    |

### Building an Effective Champion Network

1.  Select Champions: Choose respected peers (not just managers)
2.  Train Early: Champions need info before their colleagues
3.  Equip: Provide talking points, FAQs, escalation paths
4.  Connect: Build community; regular champion meetings
5.  Recognize: Acknowledge champion contributions

<div class="study-tip">
  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If a question says adoption is low despite great training, the problem is likely **Desire** (Lack of motivation/WIIFM). Training solves "Knowledge/Ability," but it cannot solve "Desire."
