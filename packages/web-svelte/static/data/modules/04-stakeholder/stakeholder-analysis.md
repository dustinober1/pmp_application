# 4.1 Stakeholder Analysis

**ECO Task**: Engage stakeholders

"You can't manage what you haven't identified." Stakeholder analysis is the process of systematically gathering and analyzing qualitative and quantitative information to determine whose interests should be taken into account throughout the project.

## The PMP Mental Model (Continuous Loop)
Stakeholder analysis is not a one-time kickoff exercise. It is a cycle you repeat whenever the project environment shifts:

1.  **Identify** stakeholders (including "shadow" stakeholders with informal power).
2.  **Analyze** power, interest, influence, and attitude (supportive vs resistant).
3.  **Prioritize** where to spend time and political capital.
4.  **Plan** engagement + communications (how you build and maintain support).
5.  **Monitor & Update** as roles, risks, scope, and priorities change.

### Inputs you'll see in exam scenarios
*   **Project Charter / Business Case**: Why the project exists and who sponsors value.
*   **Org structure & governance**: Who can approve, block, or accelerate decisions.
*   **Requirements / product vision**: Who defines "done" and accepts deliverables.
*   **Agreements / vendors**: External stakeholders with contract leverage.
*   **Regulatory / community constraints**: Legitimacy and urgency can outweigh formal authority.

### Outputs (what you update first)
*   **Stakeholder Register**: The living ledger of stakeholder intelligence.
*   **Engagement Assessment Matrix**: Current vs desired engagement.
*   **Stakeholder Engagement Plan**: Actions to close engagement gaps.
*   **Communications Management Plan**: The "what/when/how" of information flow.

::: tip 🧠 Exam Pattern
If the scenario says **new stakeholder**, **changed attitude**, **political conflict**, or **unclear decision authority**, the best "first" action is usually to **update the Stakeholder Register** and **reanalyze** before escalating or changing the plan.

## 🔍 Identification Techniques

Effective stakeholder identification uses multiple techniques to ensure no one is missed:

*   **Brainstorming**: Facilitated sessions with the team to list all potential stakeholders. Use prompts like "Who pays?", "Who uses?", "Who approves?", "Who blocks?".
*   **Expert Judgment**: Consult SMEs, past project managers, and organizational veterans who understand the political landscape.
*   **Stakeholder Templates**: Use organizational checklists (standard roles like Legal, Compliance, HR, Procurement) to ensure coverage.
*   **Org Chart Analysis**: Walk through the formal organization chart, but remember: influence doesn't always follow the lines.

### The "Snowball" Technique (Most Effective)
Ask every identified stakeholder: **"Who else should I be talking to about this project?"** This uncovers:
*   Shadow stakeholders with informal power
*   End-users who weren't included in planning
*   External parties (suppliers, regulators, community groups)
*   Champions and detractors you didn't know existed

## 📊 The RACI Matrix Connection

Stakeholder analysis and the RACI Matrix work together. RACI defines **accountability** while stakeholder analysis defines **influence and interest**.

| Role                  | Description                           | Stakeholder Implication             |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------- |
| **R - Responsible**   | Does the work                         | Team members; need detailed task communication |
| **A - Accountable**   | Owns the outcome; makes final call    | Usually one person; decision authority stakeholder |
| **C - Consulted**     | Provides input before decisions       | SMEs, affected parties; need interactive communication |
| **I - Informed**      | Updated after decisions               | Broader stakeholder groups; need push communication |

::: warning ⚠️ Common RACI Mistakes on the Exam
*   More than one "A" per deliverable = unclear accountability
*   No "A" assigned = no one owns the outcome
*   Confusing "Consulted" with "Informed" = wrong communication method

### RACI Example (Exam-Ready)

| Deliverable       | Sponsor | PM | Dev Lead | QA | Legal |
| :---------------- | :------ | :-- | :------- | :-- | :---- |
| Project Charter   | A       | R  | C        | I  | I     |
| Technical Design  | I       | C  | A/R      | C  | I     |
| Compliance Review | I       | R  | C        | I  | A     |
| Go-Live Decision  | A       | R  | C        | C  | C     |

## 🎯 Stakeholder Categories (Comprehensive List)

Understanding stakeholder categories helps ensure complete identification:

### Internal Stakeholders

## 🧮 Stakeholder Analysis Framework

For structured analysis, use this framework for each stakeholder:

### The 5W+1H Stakeholder Analysis

1.  **WHO** are they? (Role, organization, formal/informal position)
2.  **WHAT** do they need? (Requirements, expectations, success criteria)
3.  **WHY** do they care? (Underlying interests, fears, motivations)
4.  **WHEN** do they need it? (Timing, milestones, decision points)
5.  **WHERE** are they? (Location, time zone, communication access)
6.  **HOW** will you engage? (Channel, frequency, format, relationship)

### Stakeholder Analysis Questions (Fast Assessment)

For quick stakeholder profiling, answer these questions:

**Power Assessment:**
*   Can they kill or delay the project?
*   Do they control budget, resources, or approvals?
*   Does their opinion carry weight with decision-makers?

**Interest Assessment:**
*   Will the project change their work, metrics, or status?
*   Do they have direct benefit or risk from the outcome?
*   Are they accountable for areas the project impacts?

**Attitude Assessment:**
*   Are they advocating for or against the project?
*   What past experiences shape their view of this initiative?
*   What would shift them toward greater support?

## The Analysis Journey
Identifying stakeholders is more than just a list of names; it's about understanding the hidden power dynamics of the organization.

*   **4.1a Mapping**: Using the Power/Interest Grid and Salience Model to prioritize engagement.
*   **4.1b Classification**: Maintaining the Stakeholder Register and analyzing direction of influence.

## 2026 Shift: Stakeholder Diversity
In the modern project environment, stakeholders are more diverse than ever. You must consider:

### Digital Stakeholders
*   **AI/ML System Owners**: Responsible for automated decision systems
*   **Data Privacy Officers**: GDPR, CCPA, and data protection compliance
*   **Cybersecurity Teams**: Security requirements and risk tolerance
*   **Cloud/Infrastructure**: Platform dependencies and SLAs

### Global Stakeholders
*   **Time Zone Management**: Asynchronous vs synchronous communication needs
*   **Cultural Considerations**: High-context vs low-context communication styles
*   **Holiday and Work Patterns**: Religious and national calendars
*   **Language Requirements**: Translation, localization, accessibility

### Sustainability Stakeholders
*   **ESG Auditors**: Environmental, Social, Governance reporting
*   **Community Impact Groups**: Local residents, environmental advocates
*   **Sustainability Officers**: Carbon footprint, waste reduction goals
*   **Ethical Sourcing**: Supply chain responsibility

::: tip 🔍 Pro Tip: The Shadow Stakeholder
The most dangerous stakeholder is the one you didn't find. Always ask your known stakeholders: *"Who else should I be talking to about this?"*
