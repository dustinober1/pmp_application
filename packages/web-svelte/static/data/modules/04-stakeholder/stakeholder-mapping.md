# 4.1a Stakeholder Mapping

**ECO Task**: Analyze stakeholders

Stakeholder mapping is the process of visually categorizing stakeholders based on their attributes (e.g., power, interest, influence, attitude). This helps the PM prioritize engagement efforts and develop tailored strategies.

## Key Mapping Models

### 1. Power/Interest Grid (Most Common on Exam!)

* **Description**: Maps stakeholders based on their **Power** (ability to influence project outcomes) and **Interest** (how much they care about the project).
* **Purpose**: To identify general engagement strategies.

<div class="grid-container">
 <div class="grid-item high-power high-interest">
 <strong>High Power, High Interest</strong><br>
 <strong>Strategy: Manage Closely</strong>
 <p>These are your key players. Engage them frequently and involve them in decision-making. Keep them satisfied and informed.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="grid-item high-power low-interest">
 <strong>High Power, Low Interest</strong><br>
 <strong>Strategy: Keep Satisfied</strong>
 <p>Ensure their needs are met, but don't over-engage. Keep them informed enough to prevent dissatisfaction.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="grid-item low-power high-interest">
 <strong>Low Power, High Interest</strong><br>
 <strong>Strategy: Keep Informed</strong>
 <p>These stakeholders can be valuable sources of information and support. Keep them adequately informed and consult them on relevant issues.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="grid-item low-power low-interest">
 <strong>Low Power, Low Interest</strong><br>
 <strong>Strategy: Monitor</strong>
 <p>Require minimal effort. Keep an eye on them, but don't overwhelm them with communication.</p>
 </div>
</div>

::: tip Exam Insight
Many PMP questions about stakeholder engagement will involve a scenario where you first need to categorize a stakeholder using the Power/Interest Grid to determine the best engagement strategy.

### 2. Power/Influence Grid

* **Description**: Similar to Power/Interest, but uses **Influence** (ability to impact project decisions or outcomes) instead of interest.
* **Purpose**: Useful when the stakeholder's ability to sway others is more critical than their direct interest.

### 3. Power/Impact Grid

* **Description**: Maps stakeholders based on their **Power** and the **Impact** their actions can have on the project.
* **Purpose**: Focuses on managing the most potentially disruptive stakeholders.

### 4. Salience Model (Complex Scenarios)

* **Description**: Classifies stakeholders based on three attributes:
 * **Power**: Ability to impose their will.
 * **Legitimacy**: Perception of their actions as appropriate, proper, or desirable.
 * **Urgency**: Need for immediate attention (time-sensitive, critical to stakeholder).
* **Purpose**: For complex projects with a large, diverse stakeholder community where a simple grid is insufficient. It identifies "definitive stakeholders" (those with all three attributes) who require the most attention.

#### Salience Model Categories (Attributes Present)

| Category | Attributes Present | Example | PM's Focus |
| :----------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Latent Stakeholders** (1 attribute) | 1. Power (Dormant) <br> 2. Legitimacy (Discretionary) <br> 3. Urgency (Demanding) | A CEO with no current interest (Dormant); a local community group (Discretionary); an activist (Demanding) | Minimal engagement; monitor for changes |
| **Expectant Stakeholders** (2 attributes) | 1. Power + Legitimacy (Dominant) <br> 2. Power + Urgency (Dangerous) <br> 3. Legitimacy + Urgency (Dependent) | Project Sponsor (Dominant); Union leaders (Dangerous); Regulator (Dependent) | Regular engagement; understand needs/concerns; manage carefully |
| **Definitive Stakeholders** (3 attributes) | Power + Legitimacy + Urgency | Board of Directors with immediate concerns; a regulator threatening project shutdown | Highest priority; active, frequent engagement; involve in key decisions |

### 5. Stakeholder Cube (Adds "Attitude")

* **Description**: Extends Power/Interest/Influence by adding a third dimension: **Attitude** (e.g., Supportive, Neutral, Resistant, Leading).
* **Purpose**: Provides a more nuanced view, particularly for planning specific engagement tactics.

---

## Analyzing Stakeholder Expectations & Attitudes

Mapping is not just about coordinates on a grid; it's about understanding the human element.

### What to Analyze:

* **Interests**: What do they gain or lose from the project? (e.g., financial, career, political).
* **Expectations**: What do they anticipate from the project? (e.g., deadlines, quality, specific features).
* **Influence**: Their ability to impact project outcomes (e.g., formal authority, informal networks, access to resources).
* **Attitude**: Their current stance towards the project (e.g., supportive, resistant, neutral).
* **Relationships**: Their connections to other stakeholders.
* **Organizational Role**: Their position in the hierarchy, access to information, decision-making authority.

### Practical Mapping Examples

| Stakeholder | Power | Interest | Influence | Attitude | Classification (Grid) | Strategy |
| :--------------- | :----- | :------- | :-------- | :--------- | :-------------------- | :------------------ |
| Project Sponsor | High | High | High | Supportive | Manage Closely | Frequent updates, involve in key decisions, empower |
| Functional Mgr. | High | Medium | Medium | Neutral | Keep Satisfied | Regular updates on resource impact, address concerns |
| End User Group | Low | High | Medium | Resistant | Keep Informed / Involved | Address concerns, demonstrate benefits, solicit feedback |
| Regulator | High | Medium | High | Neutral | Manage Closely (Salience) | Proactive compliance updates, formal communication |
| Junior Team Member | Low | High | Low | Supportive | Keep Informed | Regular team meetings, empower, solicit ideas |

::: tip Exam Insight
When a question describes a stakeholder's **attitude (e.g., resistant, supportive)**, you're usually being led to an **Engagement Assessment Matrix** or a **Stakeholder Cube** scenario, which requires a specific influencing or communication strategy.

## Finding "Hidden" Stakeholders

Not all influential stakeholders appear on organizational charts or initial brainstorming sessions.

* **Informal Influencers**: People without formal authority but with significant impact (e.g., long-term employees, respected technical experts).
* **Shadow Teams**: Groups working on similar initiatives in parallel.
* **External Groups**: Local community, environmental activists, industry consortia.
* **Future Users**: People who will be affected by the project's outcome long after it's delivered.
* **Silent Sufferers**: Those negatively impacted but lack a voice.

### Techniques to Uncover Hidden Stakeholders

1. **Snowball Sampling**: Ask identified stakeholders, "Who else should I be talking to?"
2. **Observation**: Watch for informal leaders, people others defer to.
3. **Historical Records**: Lessons learned from similar past projects.
4. **Issue Log/Risk Register**: Frequent sources of issues or risks often point to unidentified stakeholders.

## Adapting Engagement: The Continuous Process

Stakeholder mapping is not a one-time exercise. It's continuous.

* **Review Regularly**: Revisit your stakeholder maps and classifications at key project milestones, after major changes, or when new issues arise.
* **Be Flexible**: Stakeholder attributes (power, interest, attitude) can change. Your strategies must adapt.
* **Document Changes**: Update the Stakeholder Register and related plans to reflect new information.

<div class="study-tip">
 <strong> Exam Insight:</strong> If a stakeholder's **power** is high but their **interest** is low, your goal is to **Keep Them Satisfied**. This usually means providing them with the information they need without over-engaging them, to prevent them from becoming an impediment.
