# 4.1b Classification & The Register

**ECO Task**: Identify and categorize stakeholders

After identifying who your stakeholders are, the next crucial step is to classify them. This helps you understand their potential impact on the project and tailor your engagement strategies. The **Stakeholder Register** is the central repository for this information.

## The Stakeholder Register

The Stakeholder Register is a formal document that lists all identified stakeholders and pertinent information about them. It's a living document that must be updated continuously throughout the project lifecycle.

### Components of the Stakeholder Register

1. **Identification Information**:

- Name, Title, Organization, Location, Contact Details.
- Role on the project (e.g., Sponsor, Customer, Team Member).

2. **Assessment Information**:

- Major requirements, expectations, and interests regarding the project.
- Potential impact (positive or negative) on the project.
- Attitude (e.g., Supportive, Resistant, Neutral).
- Influence, Power, and/or Urgency.

3. **Classification**:

- Key classification model used (e.g., Power/Interest, Salience Model).
- Engagement level (current and desired).

### What "Good" Looks Like (PMP-Ready Detail)

Your Stakeholder Register isn't just a list; it's a strategic tool.

- **PMP Focus**: The register should contain enough detail to inform engagement, but not so much that it becomes cumbersome or violates privacy.
- **Dynamic**: It should be updated whenever a new stakeholder is identified, an existing stakeholder's attitude changes, or their influence/power shifts.

## Direction of Influence (Exam Favorite!)

Understanding the direction of a stakeholder's influence helps tailor communication and engagement.

- **Upward**: Influencing senior management, project sponsor, steering committee.
- _Communication Style_: Formal, data-driven, strategic.
- **Downward**: Influencing the project team or other direct reports.
- _Communication Style_: Clear instructions, coaching, motivating.
- **Outward**: Influencing external parties like vendors, customers, regulators.
- _Communication Style_: Formal, contractual, relationship-focused.
- **Sideward**: Influencing peers, other project managers, functional managers.
- _Communication Style_: Collaborative, persuasive, reciprocal.

::: tip Exam Scenario
If a project is struggling due to lack of executive support, the PM needs to influence **Upward**. If a vendor is non-compliant, the PM needs to influence **Outward**.

## The Engagement Assessment Matrix (Closing the Gap)

This matrix tracks the current and desired engagement level of key stakeholders. The "Engagement Gap" is the difference between the current and desired state, which informs your engagement strategy.

| Stakeholder | Current Engagement | Desired Engagement | Gap (Action Needed) | Strategy                                                |
| :---------- | :----------------- | :----------------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| Sponsor     | Supportive         | Leading            | Close               | Involve in key decisions, empower to remove blockers    |
| User Group  | Resistant          | Supportive         | Close               | Address concerns, demonstrate value, involve in testing |
| Legal Dept. | Neutral            | Supportive         | Close               | Proactive compliance updates, solicit feedback          |
| Competitor  | Unaware            | Unaware            | Maintain            | Monitor for changes; minimal engagement                 |

### The 5 Engagement States

1. **Unaware**: No knowledge of the project.
2. **Resistant**: Aware, but opposes the project.
3. **Neutral**: Aware, but neither supports nor opposes.
4. **Supportive**: Aware and supports the project.
5. **Leading**: Aware and actively engaged in ensuring project success.

_PM's Role_: Develop strategies to move stakeholders from their current state to the desired state, especially for those in "Resistant" or "Neutral" categories who have high power/interest.

### Closing the Engagement Gap

- **For Unaware**: Information sharing (Push communication).
- **For Resistant**: Understand root cause of resistance; address concerns directly; involve them in problem-solving; influence strategies (Persuasion).
- **For Neutral**: Engage them more; highlight benefits to them (WIIFM); seek their input.
- **For Supportive**: Maintain engagement; empower them; use them as champions.
- **For Leading**: Empower them; delegate tasks; involve them in decision-making; leverage their influence.

## Stakeholder Engagement Plan vs. Communications Management Plan

These two plans are closely related but serve distinct purposes.

| Plan                               | Focus                                     | Typical Contents                                   | When to Update                                           |
| :--------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stakeholder Engagement Plan**    | _How_ to effectively involve stakeholders | Strategies for each stakeholder, engagement levels | When stakeholder analysis changes, engagement gaps exist |
| **Communications Management Plan** | _How_ to disseminate project information  | What, when, how, by whom, to whom for project info | When communication needs or methods change               |

::: warning Exam Insight: Update First!
If a stakeholder's attitude changes, update the **Stakeholder Register** _first_, then re-evaluate the **Engagement Assessment Matrix**, and finally update the **Stakeholder Engagement Plan**. The Communications Management Plan then implements the strategy.

## 2026 PMP Focus: Stakeholder Metrics

Beyond just identifying and classifying, the 2026 exam emphasizes measuring the effectiveness of your engagement.

### Engagement Health Indicators

- **Meeting Attendance/Participation**: Are key stakeholders showing up and contributing?
- **Feedback Response Rate**: Are stakeholders providing timely input?
- **Issue Resolution Time**: How quickly are stakeholder concerns addressed?
- **Change Request Acceptance Rate**: Are stakeholders aligning with project changes?
- **Survey Scores**: Periodic surveys on satisfaction and perceived value.

### Leading vs. Lagging Indicators

- **Leading**: Early warnings (e.g., declining meeting attendance, missed feedback deadlines).
- **Lagging**: After-the-fact results (e.g., project delays due to lack of approval, negative sentiment in post-project surveys).

<div class="study-tip">
 <strong> Exam Insight:</strong> The **Stakeholder Register** is a living document. Any time a new stakeholder is identified, an old one leaves, or a stakeholder's influence/interest/attitude changes, the register should be updated. This is often the *first* step in many stakeholder-related scenarios.
