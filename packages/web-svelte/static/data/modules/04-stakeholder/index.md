# Chapter 4: Stakeholder & Communication

Stakeholders are the "Why" behind every "What." In the 2026 PMP exam, success isn't just delivering a product; it's delivering **Value** that stakeholders accept and support.

## The Engagement Cycle

Moving people from "Unaware" to "Leading."

The document outlines several sections related to stakeholder management:

- **4.1 Stakeholder Analysis**: Covers Power/Interest grids, the Salience Model, RACI integration, and finding "Hidden" stakeholders.
- **4.1a Stakeholder Mapping**: Details Power/Interest Grid, Salience Model, Stakeholder Cube, and practical mapping examples.
- **4.1b Classification & Register**: Focuses on building the Stakeholder Register, Engagement Assessment Matrix, and closing engagement gaps.
- **4.2 Comm. Planning**: Discusses Push/Pull/Interactive communication, feedback loops, cultural context, and global async communication.
- **4.3 Active Engagement**: Involves building trust, influence strategies, coalition building, and managing expectations.
- **4.4 Negotiation**: Covers interest-based negotiation, BATNA, conflict resolution, and decision-making models.
- A **Knowledge Check** section with 25 comprehensive questions is also included.

# 2026 Mindset: Influence without Authority

You cannot "order" a stakeholder to like your project. You must earn it.

## Core Competencies

- **Inclusion**: Proactively inviting the quiet voices to speak.
- **Transparency**: Sharing bad news early to build trust.
- **Empathy**: Understanding that "Resistance" is usually just "Fear of the Unknown."
- **Cultural Intelligence**: Adapting communication style to global, diverse teams.

## Key Models to Master

- **Power/Interest Grid**: Used to prioritize engagement approach during initial mapping and ongoing review.
- **Salience Model**: Analyzes Power + Legitimacy + Urgency for complex stakeholder ecosystems.
- **Stakeholder Cube**: Adds the Attitude dimension to understand resistors and supporters.
- **Engagement Assessment**: Compares current vs. desired state for planning engagement tactics.
- **RACI Matrix**: Clarifies accountability for role assignment and communication.

## Critical Formulas

**Communication Channels**: $N \times (N-1) / 2$

- For a team of 5, there are 10 channels.
- For a team of 10, there are 45 channels.
- For a team of 15, there are 105 channels.

## Exam Patterns

- **"New stakeholder identified..."** → Update Stakeholder Register first.
- **"Stakeholder is resistant..."** → Direct engagement + root cause + update engagement plan.
- **"Communication breakdown..."** → Update Communications Management Plan.
- **"Conflict between parties..."** → Default to Collaborate unless emergency.
- **"Vendor dispute..."** → Direct negotiation first using contract terms.
