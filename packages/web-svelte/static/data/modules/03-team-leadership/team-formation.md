# 3.1a Team Formation & Acquisition

**ECO Task**: Build a team

The foundation of project success often lies in forming the right team. This involves more than just assigning individuals; it requires strategic consideration of skills, roles, and organizational context.

## Key Tools & Techniques for Team Formation

### 1. Skills Matrix & Gap Analysis

- **Skills Matrix**: A grid that lists the skills required for the project and the current proficiency levels of potential team members.
- _Purpose_: Identifies available expertise and skill gaps.
- **Gap Analysis**: Comparing required skills vs. available skills to determine what training, hiring, or external resources are needed.
- _PM's Role_: Use this to justify resource requests or plan for team development.

### 2. Roles, Responsibilities, and Authority

- **RACI Chart (Responsibility Assignment Matrix)**: Clarifies roles and responsibilities for specific tasks or deliverables.
- **R**esponsible: The person who performs the work.
- **A**ccountable: The person ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the deliverable or task, and who ensures prerequisites are met. (Only one A per task!).
- **C**onsulted: Those whose opinions are sought (two-way communication).
- **I**nformed: Those who are kept up-to-date on progress (one-way communication).
- _PM's Role_: Facilitate RACI development with the team; ensure clarity and buy-in.
- **Organizational Charts**: Helps understand the formal reporting relationships and authority levels.
- **Position Descriptions**: Defines the roles, responsibilities, and authority of each team member.

### 3. Resource Management Plan

- **Resource Calendar**: Specifies when and how long project team members will be available.
- **Resource Breakdown Structure (RBS)**: A hierarchical list of resources by category and type.
- **Resource Histogram**: Visualizes resource allocation over time, helping to identify overallocation or underutilization.

## Resource Acquisition (Getting the Right People)

Project Managers often need to acquire resources from various sources.

### 1. Pre-Assignment

- **Definition**: When project team members are identified and assigned in advance.
- _Why_: Often due to specific expertise, contractual obligations, or being part of a functional team that will transfer to the project.
- _PM's Role_: Integrate pre-assigned members smoothly; ensure they understand project goals.

### 2. Negotiation

- **Definition**: PMs often negotiate with functional managers or other PMs for specific resources.
- _Key_: Understand project needs, resource skills, and be prepared to articulate the value proposition of your project.
- _PM's Role_: Use clear communication, provide alternatives, and highlight benefits to the functional manager (e.g., skill development for their employee).

### 3. Virtual Teams (See 3.1d)

- **Definition**: Teams with members from different geographical locations or organizations.
- _Considerations_: Communication challenges, cultural differences, time zones, technology.
- _PM's Role_: Establish clear communication protocols, leverage collaboration tools, foster trust and cohesion.

### 4. Co-location

- **Definition**: Physically placing the project team members in the same location.
- _Benefits_: Enhanced communication (verbal and non-verbal), improved team cohesion, faster decision-making.
- _PM's Role_: Facilitate office setup; minimize distractions; encourage interaction.

## Organizational Structures & PM Authority

The organizational structure significantly impacts the PM's authority and resource acquisition.

| Structure        | PM Authority | Resource Availability | Example                                                      |
| :--------------- | :----------- | :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Functional**   | Low          | Low                   | Projects run within departments; PM has little authority.    |
| **Matrix**       | Medium       | Medium                | PM shares authority with functional managers.                |
| **Projectized**  | High         | High                  | PM has full authority and team reports directly to PM.       |
| **Hybrid/Agile** | Varies       | Varies                | PM (or Scrum Master) acts as a servant leader, facilitating. |

::: tip Exam Insight
In a **Matrix** organization (the most common on the exam), the PM often needs strong **negotiation** and **influencing** skills to acquire and manage resources, as functional managers typically control the personnel.

## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) in Team Formation

Building diverse teams is not just ethical; it leads to better project outcomes and innovation.

- **Diversity**: The presence of differences (e.g., gender, ethnicity, age, experience, thought).

- **Inclusion**: Creating an environment where all individuals feel welcome, respected, and valued.

_PM's Role_:

- **Actively seek diverse talent**: Look beyond traditional sources.
- **Mitigate unconscious bias**: In hiring, assignment, and decision-making.
- **Foster an inclusive environment**: Promote psychological safety where all voices are heard.
- **Address microaggressions**: Actively challenge exclusionary behaviors.
