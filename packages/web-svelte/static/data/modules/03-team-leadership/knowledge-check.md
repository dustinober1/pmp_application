{
text: 'A project team member constantly complains about project tasks, misses deadlines, and frequently expresses disinterest. When confronted, they state, "This isn\'t what I signed up for." Which of Tuckman\'s stages is the team likely experiencing?',
options: [
'Forming',
'Storming',
'Norming',
'Performing'
],
correct: 1,
explanation: 'Complaining, missing deadlines, and expressing disinterest are common characteristics of the Storming phase, where team members are testing boundaries, expressing individuality, and experiencing conflict.',
reference: 'Section 3.1b - Tuckman\'s Model'
},
{
text: 'A highly skilled and motivated team member is struggling with a newly assigned, complex technical task that requires skills they don\'t yet possess. According to Situational Leadership II (SLII), what is the most appropriate leadership style for the PM to adopt?',
options: [
'Directing (S1)',
'Coaching (S2)',
'Supporting (S3)',
'Delegating (S4)'
],
correct: 1,
explanation: 'SLII recommends matching leadership style to the team member\'s development level. For a highly motivated but low competence individual on a new task, a Directing (S1) style is best: high direction, low support. They need clear instructions on _how_ to do the task.',
reference: 'Section 3.2 - Situational Leadership II'
},
{
text: 'According to Herzberg\'s Two-Factor Theory, which of the following is a motivator that contributes to job satisfaction?',
options: [
'Salary increases',
'Improved working conditions',
'Job security',
'Opportunities for advancement'
],
correct: 3,
explanation: 'Motivators (satisfiers) are factors that lead to satisfaction, such as achievement, recognition, responsibility, and advancement. Salary, working conditions, and job security are hygiene factors (dissatisfiers) that prevent dissatisfaction but do not create satisfaction.',
reference: 'Section 3.4 - Herzberg Two-Factor Theory'
},
{
text: 'Two team members are in a heated disagreement about the technical approach for a critical module. Both are highly assertive and cooperative. The PM wants to find the best possible solution and maintain a strong relationship. Which conflict resolution mode should the PM facilitate?',
options: [
'Compromising',
'Forcing',
'Collaborating/Problem Solving',
'Accommodating/Smoothing'
],
correct: 2,
explanation: 'When both parties are highly assertive and cooperative, and the goal is the best solution while preserving relationships, Collaborating (Win-Win) is the optimal mode. It involves open discussion to find a mutually agreeable solution.',
reference: 'Section 3.3 - Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode'
},
{
text: 'A Project Manager needs to clarify responsibilities for testing, quality assurance, and deployment for an upcoming release. Which tool or technique would be MOST effective?',
options: [
'Organizational Breakdown Structure (OBS)',
'Resource Breakdown Structure (RBS)',
'Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM) / RACI Chart',
'Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)'
],
correct: 2,
explanation: 'A RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) chart, a type of RAM, is specifically designed to clarify roles and responsibilities for specific tasks or deliverables, making it ideal for this situation.',
reference: 'Section 3.1a - RACI'
},
{
text: 'A team member expresses a lack of motivation, stating that no matter how hard they work, they never receive recognition or promotions. Which motivation theory best explains this team member\'s perspective?',

'Pink\'s Drive Theory'
],
correct: 1,
explanation: 'Vroom\'s Expectancy Theory states that motivation is based on the expectation that effort leads to performance, performance leads to reward, and the value of that reward. This team member lacks the "performance leads to reward" linkage (Instrumentality).',
reference: 'Section 3.4 - Vroom\'s Expectancy Theory'
},
{
text: 'During a sprint retrospective, a team identifies that communication breakdowns frequently occur, leading to missed dependencies. The team wants to establish clear guidelines for communication channels, response times, and decision-making authority. Where should these be documented?',
options: [
'Project Management Plan',
'Risk Register',
'Team Charter',
'Stakeholder Engagement Plan'
],
correct: 2,
explanation: 'A Team Charter is the document where the team collaboratively establishes its operating guidelines, including communication protocols, decision-making processes, conflict resolution procedures, and other ground rules.',
reference: 'Section 3.1c - Team Charter'
},
{
text: 'A project manager is leading a highly diverse, globally distributed virtual team. Team members frequently misunderstand each other\'s intentions in written communication and have differing expectations about response times. Which cultural dimension, according to Hofstede, is most likely contributing to these challenges?',
options: [
'Power Distance',
'Individualism vs. Collectivism',
'Uncertainty Avoidance',
'High-Context vs. Low-Context Communication'
],
correct: 3,
explanation: 'While not a direct Hofstede dimension, the challenge describes differing communication styles. Hofstede\'s dimensions provide a framework to understand cultural differences that influence these communication issues, particularly in High-Context vs. Low-Context cultures which affect how explicitly messages need to be communicated. Uncertainty Avoidance also plays a role in how comfortable cultures are with ambiguous communication.',
reference: 'Section 3.1d - Hofstede\'s Cultural Dimensions'
},
{
text: 'A project manager observes that a senior technical expert is highly competent and motivated but prefers to work independently and resents direct instruction. What is the most appropriate leadership style for the PM to employ with this individual?',
options: [
'Directing (S1)',
'Coaching (S2)',
'Supporting (S3)',
'Delegating (S4)'
],
correct: 3,
explanation: 'According to SLII, for individuals with high competence and high commitment/motivation, a Delegating (S4) style is best: low direction, low support. The PM empowers them to make decisions and provides minimal oversight.',
reference: 'Section 3.2 - Situational Leadership II'
},
{
text: 'Two functional managers are disputing which of their team members will be assigned to a critical project role, leading to project delays. The Project Manager has no direct authority over either manager. What is the PM\'s BEST initial approach?',
options: [
'Force a decision by escalating to the Project Sponsor',
'Compromise by splitting the role between both team members',
'Facilitate a collaborative meeting to discuss the project needs and team member strengths',
'Withdraw from the conflict, hoping it resolves itself'
],
correct: 2,
explanation: 'Since the PM has no direct authority, forcing or withdrawing are not ideal. Compromising (splitting the role) might lead to an inefficient outcome. The best approach is to facilitate collaboration, using data (skills matrix, project needs) to guide the functional managers to a mutually beneficial solution.',
reference: 'Section 3.3 - Conflict Resolution Process'
},
{
text: 'Google\'s Project Aristotle identified several key factors for successful teams. Which of the following did it conclude was the MOST important element?',
options: [
'Individual team member intelligence',
'Dependability',
'Clear goals and structure',
'Psychological safety'
],
correct: 3,
explanation: 'Project Aristotle found that psychological safety—the belief that one can take risks without fear of negative consequences—was the most crucial factor for team effectiveness, underpinning all other elements.',
reference: 'Section 3.1b - Psychological Safety'
},
{
text: 'A team member is consistently late for meetings, interrupting others, and not actively participating in discussions. The team\'s charter outlines expectations for punctuality and respectful communication. What is the PM\'s BEST initial action?',
options: [
'Publicly call out the team member during a team meeting',
'Update the team charter with stricter rules and penalties',
'Have a private one-on-one conversation with the team member to discuss the observed behavior and its impact',
'Ignore the behavior, assuming the team will self-correct'
],
correct: 2,
explanation: 'The best initial action is a private conversation. This allows the PM to understand the root cause of the behavior, reinforce the team charter\'s expectations, and coach the team member, while avoiding public embarrassment or damaging team morale.',
reference: 'Section 3.3 - Conflict Resolution Process'
},
{
text: 'Your project involves integrating two legacy systems. The technical lead from System A and the technical lead from System B have fundamentally different ideas on the best integration architecture, leading to frequent stalemates. What type of conflict is this?',
options: [
'Relationship Conflict',
'Process Conflict',
'Task Conflict',
'Interpersonal Conflict'
],
correct: 2,
explanation: 'This is a Task Conflict because the disagreement is about the technical approach or method of completing the work. It is not personal (Relationship) and is about the content of the task itself, not just how they work together (Process).',
reference: 'Section 3.3 - Types of Conflict'
},
{
text: 'In a negotiation with a vendor, your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement) is to use an in-house solution that will cost $150,000. The vendor offers a solution for $175,000. What should be your immediate response?',
options: [
'Accept the vendor\'s offer, as it\'s a reasonable price',
'Reject the vendor\'s offer, as it\'s higher than your BATNA',
'Try to negotiate the price down to $140,000',
'Walk away from the negotiation, as there is no ZOPA'
],
correct: 1,
explanation: 'Your BATNA is your walk-away point. If the vendor\'s offer ($175,000) is higher than your BATNA ($150,000), it means you can get a better outcome by walking away and using your alternative. You should continue to negotiate down or walk away. There is no ZOPA if your maximum willingness to pay (derived from BATNA) is $150,000 and their offer is $175,000.',
reference: 'Section 3.3 - BATNA/ZOPA'
},
{
text: 'A virtual team member consistently misses important details from asynchronous communication channels. What is the PM\'s BEST strategy to address this?',
options: [
'Implement stricter penalties for missed communications',
'Require all communications to be synchronous (e.g., video calls)',
'Establish explicit remote working agreements, including clear expectations for monitoring and responding to asynchronous channels',
'Assign a "communication buddy" to manually relay all important information'
],
correct: 2,
explanation: 'Explicit remote working agreements (part of a virtual team charter) are crucial for distributed teams. This proactive approach sets clear expectations and norms for communication, rather than resorting to penalties, forcing synchronous communication, or creating inefficient manual processes.',
reference: 'Section 3.1d - Virtual Teams'
},
{
text: 'According to McClelland\'s Acquired Needs Theory, a team member who is driven by challenges, setting high goals, and receiving individual recognition for their accomplishments has a high need for:',
options: [
'Achievement',
'Affiliation',
'Power',
'Security'
],
correct: 0,
explanation: 'Individuals with a high need for Achievement are motivated by challenging tasks, personal accomplishment, and feedback on their performance. They prefer working alone or with other high achievers.',
reference: 'Section 3.4 - McClelland\'s Theory of Needs'
},
{
text: 'The Project Manager observes a consistent pattern of a team member dominating discussions, making unilateral decisions, and frequently interrupting others. This behavior stems from the team member\'s belief that they are the most experienced. What type of power is this team member attempting to exert?',
options: [
'Legitimate Power',
'Reward Power',
'Expert Power',
'Coercive Power'
],
correct: 2,
explanation: 'Expert Power comes from an individual\'s specialized knowledge, skills, or experience. The team member is leveraging their perceived expertise to influence or control the team\'s actions, even without formal authority.',
reference: 'Section 3.2 - Types of Power'
},
{
text: 'The team has been struggling with unclear requirements and frequently delivers incomplete work. During a team chartering session, they agree to define a clear "Definition of Done" for all deliverables. This will help address which of the following?',
options: [
'Team motivation',
'Interpersonal conflict',
'Scope creep',
'Quality and clarity of work'
],
correct: 3,
explanation: 'A clear Definition of Done (DoD) provides unambiguous criteria for when a task or deliverable is considered complete, directly improving the quality and clarity of work and reducing misunderstandings about expectations.',
reference: 'Section 3.1c - Team Charter'
},
{
text: 'The Project Manager is forming a new team for a complex, innovative project. They want to ensure the team has diverse perspectives and avoids groupthink. Which of Hofstede\'s cultural dimensions should the PM pay particular attention to when selecting team members from different countries?',
options: [
'Long-Term Orientation',
'Indulgence vs. Restraint',
'Uncertainty Avoidance',
'Masculinity vs. Femininity'
],
correct: 2,
explanation: 'Uncertainty Avoidance measures a society\'s tolerance for ambiguity and uncertainty. Teams with mixed levels of uncertainty avoidance can bring diverse approaches to risk, planning, and problem-solving, which can be beneficial for complex, innovative projects that inherently involve ambiguity.',
reference: 'Section 3.1d - Hofstede\'s Cultural Dimensions'
},
{
text: 'A team member comes to you, the Project Manager, with a proposal for an innovative but high-risk feature. They are highly enthusiastic but lack a clear plan for implementation or risk mitigation. According to Situational Leadership II (SLII), what is the most appropriate leadership style for the PM to adopt?',
options: [
'Directing (S1)',
'Coaching (S2)',
'Supporting (S3)',
'Delegating (S4)'
],
correct: 1,
explanation: 'This team member exhibits high commitment/motivation but low competence regarding this specific high-risk plan. A Coaching (S2) style (high direction, high support) is appropriate: guide them in developing the plan and mitigating risks, while leveraging their enthusiasm.',
reference: 'Section 3.2 - Situational Leadership II'
},
{
text: 'Which of the following is a key element of establishing psychological safety within a project team?',
options: [
'Strict adherence to individual performance metrics',
'Encouraging constructive debate and respectful disagreement',
'Punishing mistakes to ensure accountability',
'Assigning tasks only to the most experienced members'
],
correct: 1,
explanation: 'Psychological safety thrives on an environment where team members feel comfortable expressing diverse opinions, challenging ideas, and engaging in constructive debate without fear of personal reprisal or embarrassment. This fosters innovation and problem-solving.',
reference: 'Section 3.1b - Psychological Safety'
},
{
text: 'A project manager is developing a team charter. Which of the following elements is LEAST likely to be included?',
options: [
'Team values and norms',
'Decision-making process',
'Individual performance goals',
'Conflict resolution guidelines'
],
correct: 2,
explanation: 'While individual performance is important, a team charter typically focuses on how the team as a collective will operate. Individual performance goals are usually handled through separate performance management processes or individual development plans, not the team charter.',
reference: 'Section 3.1c - Team Charter'
},
{
text: 'A project has critical dependencies with an external vendor. The vendor is consistently missing deadlines, jeopardizing your project\'s schedule. You\'ve tried collaborative problem-solving, but the vendor is unresponsive. What is your BATNA in this scenario?',
options: [
'Negotiate a discount with the vendor for the delays',
'Escalate the issue to your project sponsor',
'Find an alternative vendor or bring the work in-house',
'Force the vendor to adhere to the schedule through contractual penalties'
],
correct: 2,
explanation: 'Your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement) is your alternative course of action if the current negotiation fails. In this case, if the vendor isn\'t performing, your best alternative might be to switch vendors or do the work yourself, rather than simply accepting delays or escalating immediately.',
reference: 'Section 3.3 - BATNA/ZOPA'
},
{
text: 'According to Daniel Pink\'s Drive theory, which of the following is an intrinsic motivator?',

correct: 2,
explanation: 'Daniel Pink emphasizes three intrinsic motivators: Autonomy (the urge to direct our own lives), Mastery (the desire to get better at something that matters), and Purpose (the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves). Bonuses, job security, and company cars are extrinsic motivators.',
reference: 'Section 3.4 - Pink\'s Drive Theory'
},
{
text: 'The project team has moved from a co-located office to a fully remote model. Despite efforts, team morale is low, and miscommunications are frequent. What is the PM\'s MOST proactive strategy to improve team cohesion and communication?',

'Provide advanced training on remote communication tools',
'Develop and enforce explicit remote working agreements covering communication protocols, availability, and virtual meeting etiquette',
'Revert to a hybrid model with mandatory in-office days'
],
correct: 2,
explanation: 'Explicit remote working agreements are crucial for remote teams. They set clear expectations and norms, reducing ambiguity and fostering better communication and cohesion in a distributed environment. While training helps, explicit agreements govern behavior and expectations.',
