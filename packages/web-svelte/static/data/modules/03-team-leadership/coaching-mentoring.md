## 🚀 Coaching vs. Mentoring (Know the Difference!)

While both support development, they have distinct characteristics.

| Feature       | Coaching                                          | Mentoring                                     |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **Focus**     | Performance in a specific role/skill, short-term | Career development, long-term growth, broader |
| **Relationship** | Task-oriented, performance-driven                 | Relationship-oriented, personal growth        |
| **Agenda**    | Set by coachee (with coach guidance)              | Set by mentee (with mentor guidance)          |
| **Duration**  | Often time-bound, project-specific                | Long-term, informal                           |
| **Expertise** | Coach guides discovery (doesn't need to be expert) | Mentor is typically more experienced, a role model |
| **Example**   | PM coaching a team member on a new software tool  | Senior PM guiding a junior PM on career path  |

## 📈 The GROW Model (A Coaching Framework)

The GROW model is a simple, yet powerful framework for structuring a coaching conversation.

1.  **Goal**: What does the team member want to achieve? (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).
    *   *Questions*: "What do you want to accomplish?" "What does success look like?"
2.  **Reality**: What is the current situation? What are the obstacles?
    *   *Questions*: "What's happening now?" "What have you tried so far?" "What's holding you back?"
3.  **Options**: What are the possible courses of action? Brainstorm solutions.
    *   *Questions*: "What could you do?" "What are all the possibilities?" "Who can help you?"
4.  **Will (or Way Forward)**: What will the team member do? When? What support is needed?
    *   *Questions*: "What will you do next?" "When will you do it?" "What support do you need from me?"

*PM's Role*: As a coach, the PM's role is to ask powerful questions and listen actively, empowering the team member to find their own solutions, rather than providing direct answers.

## 👂 Active Listening Skills (Crucial for Coaching)

*   **Pay Attention**: Give the speaker your undivided attention.
*   **Show That You're Listening**: Nod, use verbal affirmations ("I see," "uh-huh").

*   **Defer Judgment**: Don't interrupt or offer solutions too early.
*   **Respond Appropriately**: Be open, honest, and respectful.

    *   *PM's Application*: Recognizing your own biases, understanding your impact on the team.
2.  **Self-Regulation**: Managing one's own emotions and impulses.
    *   *PM's Application*: Staying calm under pressure, managing frustrations constructively.
3.  **Motivation**: Being driven to achieve for reasons beyond external rewards.
    *   *PM's Application*: Inspiring the team, fostering a positive work environment.
4.  **Empathy**: Understanding the emotional makeup of other people.
    *   *PM's Application*: Recognizing team members' feelings, adapting your style to individual needs.
5.  **Social Skills**: Managing relationships to move people in desired directions.
    *   *PM's Application*: Conflict resolution, negotiation, communication, building rapport.

3.  **Individual Analysis**: What skills do individual team members currently possess, and what gaps exist?

*PM's Role*: Identify skill gaps, facilitate access to training, provide opportunities for practical application.
