# 3.3 Conflict Management & Negotiation

**ECO Task**: Manage conflicts

Conflict is not a sign of failure; it is a sign of passion. If your team never fights, they probably don't care. Your job is to channel that energy into innovation.

## 🚦 The Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (TKI)
The 5 conflict resolution modes are mapped on two dimensions: **Assertiveness** (concern for self) and **Cooperativeness** (concern for others).

*   **Collaborate / Problem Solve**: Win / Win. Finding a new solution that makes everyone happy. Requires time & trust.
*   **Compromise**: Lose / Lose. Everyone gives up something to reach a quick deal. Best for temporary fixes when time is limited.
*   **Force / Direct / Compete**: Win / Lose. Using authority to end debate. Limit to emergencies, safety, severe compliance.
*   **Smooth / Accommodate**: Lose / Win. Emphasizing agreement to preserve the relationship. Use when issue is minor or relationship is critical.
*   **Withdraw / Avoid**: Yield. Retreating from the conflict. Use when emotions are too high or issue is trivial.

## 🧠 Choosing the Right Mode: The Decision Matrix
The exam often asks for the **best** technique, not the fastest.

| Mode                | Use When                                     | What You Gain                        | What You Risk                             |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| **Collaborate**     | Root cause matters and you have time         | Best solution + commitment + learning | Slower; requires facilitation skill       |
| **Compromise**      | Temporary solution is acceptable; time pressure | Quick agreement                      | Mediocre outcome; may resurface later     |
| **Force / Direct**  | Emergency, safety, severe compliance         | Immediate action                     | Damaged trust; resentment; no buy-in      |
| **Smooth / Accommodate** | Issue is minor or you want to preserve relationship | Short-term harmony                   | Real issue stays unresolved               |
| **Withdraw / Avoid** | Emotions are too high or facts are unclear   | Cool-down time                       | Delays resolution; can fester             |

### The Conflict Mode Selection Flowchart
```
Is it urgent & safety-critical?
    YES → FORCE (then repair trust later)
    NO ↓

Are emotions too high for productive discussion?
    YES → WITHDRAW (temporarily) → schedule later
    NO ↓

Is this issue minor or is the relationship more important?
    YES → SMOOTH / ACCOMMODATE
    NO ↓

Do we have time to find the best solution?
    YES → COLLABORATE / PROBLEM SOLVE
    NO → COMPROMISE (temporary fix)
```
**Exam Pattern: Collaborate is the default "best"**: If the scenario is not an emergency, look for choices that involve listening, using data, and jointly creating a solution. Collaborate almost always beats Compromise in non-time-pressured scenarios.

## 🔥 Types of Conflict: Task vs. Relationship
Not all conflict is the same. Understanding the type helps you respond correctly.

| Type                      | Description                                   | Impact                            | PM Action                                   |
| :------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| **Task Conflict**         | Disagreement about work (approach, priorities, quality) | Can be healthy; drives innovation | Facilitate; let team debate; guide to decision |
| **Relationship Conflict** | Personal friction, dislike, personality clash | Always harmful; destroys trust    | Intervene early; address privately; de-escalate |
| **Process Conflict**      | Disagreement about how to work together       | Moderate; can be resolved with clarity | Clarify roles, update working agreements    |

### The Personality Trap
Most friction is caused by Scope, Schedule, or Priorities. What looks like a "personality conflict" is usually a process issue. Always look for the process issue before blaming the person.

## 🤝 Negotiation Strategies (Task 8)
Conflict often requires negotiation to resolve. On the exam, you need to know *how* you are negotiating.

### Core Negotiation Concepts

#### BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement)
Your "Plan B." If you can't reach a deal, what will you do? Never negotiate without knowing your BATNA. The stronger your BATNA, the more leverage you have. Improve your BATNA before negotiating if possible.

#### ZOPA (Zone of Possible Agreement)
The overlap between the seller's minimum price and the buyer's maximum price. If there's no ZOPA, no deal is possible without changing the terms.

#### Reservation Price
The worst acceptable outcome. If the deal is worse than this, walk away.

### The Two Negotiation Strategies
| Strategy       | Mindset                      | Outcome                 | Use When                                     |
| :------------- | :--------------------------- | :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Distributive** | "Fixed Pie" (Win-Lose)       | I get more, you get less | Buying a car; one-time transaction; no future relationship |
| **Integrative**  | "Expand the Pie" (Win-Win)   | We find value for both  | **Most project situations.** Partnerships, team agreements, long-term contracts |

### Integrative Negotiation Tactics
| Tactic                        | Description                                     | Example                                                 |
| :---------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Interests, not positions**  | Ask "why" behind their demand                   | "Why do you need it by Friday?" → They need a demo for Monday |
| **Create options**            | Brainstorm ways to meet both needs              | "What if we deliver core features Friday, polish by Monday?" |
| **Objective criteria**        | Use data, not opinion                           | "Industry benchmark says 2 weeks is reasonable"         |
| **Separate people from problems** | Focus on the issue, not the person            | "The timeline is challenging" not "You're being unrealistic" |

## 🧭 The Conflict Resolution Process
When conflict erupts, follow this escalation ladder:

### Step 1: Self-Correction
Let the team members try to solve it themselves first. Many conflicts resolve without PM intervention.

### Step 2: Private Intervention
If it persists, facilitate a safe, private conversation.

### Step 3: Collaborative Session
Bring parties together. Use data to remove emotion and focus on the problem.

### Step 4: Formal Authority
Make a decision if the team remains deadlocked.

### Step 5: Escalation
Involve sponsor or functional managers only if authority is required.

## 🧩 A Collaboration Agenda (15–30 Minutes)
Use this structure to turn conflict into a decision:

| Step                  | Time  | Action                                    |
| :-------------------- | :---- | :---------------------------------------- |
| **1. State the problem** | 2 min | Neutral language, facts not accusations  |
| **2. Confirm interests** | 5 min | What does each side truly need? (time, quality, risk, autonomy) |
| **3. Generate options** | 10 min | Brainstorm first, evaluate second         |
| **4. Agree on criteria** | 3 min | Cost, schedule, risk, customer impact, compliance |
| **5. Decide**             | 5 min | Choose the best option based on criteria  |
| **6. Assign actions**     | 2 min | Owner + due date for each action          |
| **7. Document**           | 1 min | Capture the decision; update team charter if new rule is needed |

### The Ground Rules for the Session
*   **Speak for yourself**: Use "I" statements, not "you always"
*   **Listen to understand**: No interrupting; paraphrase before responding
*   **Focus on interests, not positions**: "I need reliable data" not "I need that specific report"
*   **Critique ideas, not people**: "That approach has risks" not "That's a stupid idea"

## 🛠️ De-escalation Techniques
When emotions run high, your first job is to calm the situation before solving it.

### Verbal De-escalation
| Technique        | What to Say                                         |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| **Acknowledge**  | "I can see this is frustrating for you."            |
| **Validate**     | "Your concerns are legitimate."                     |
| **Reframe**      | "Let's focus on what we're both trying to achieve." |
| **Pause**        | "Let's take a 10-minute break and come back fresh." |
| **Summarize**    | "Let me make sure I understand your position..."    |

### Physical De-escalation
*   Move the conversation to a private space
*   Ensure people are seated (standing escalates)
*   Offer water/coffee (physiological reset)
*   Lower your own voice and slow your speech

## 📋 The Conflict Log
For recurring or significant conflicts, document to identify patterns.

| Date       | Parties      | Issue Summary           | Resolution Mode | Outcome              | Follow-up         |
| :--------- | :----------- | :---------------------- | :-------------- | :------------------- | :---------------- |
| 2026-01-15 | Dev A vs QA  | Definition of "done"    | Collaborate     | Created explicit DoD | Review in Retro   |
| 2026-01-20 | PM vs Vendor | Timeline dispute        | Compromise      | Extended 1 week      | Update schedule   |

## 🧱 Structural Solutions to Recurring Conflict
If the same conflict keeps happening, fix the system, not just the symptom.

| Pattern             | Structural Fix                               |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Role confusion**  | Create/update RACI                           |
| **Decision paralysis** | Clarify decision model in team charter       |
| **Scope creep battles** | Formalize change control process             |
| **Priority fights** | Align on prioritization criteria (value, risk, dependency) |
| **Handoff failures** | Define explicit handoff criteria and checklists |
