# 3.1b Team Development & Performance

**ECO Task**: Support team performance
**ECO Task**: Ensure team members are adequately trained and educated

A project team is more than a collection of individuals; it's a dynamic system that evolves over time. Understanding team development helps the PM anticipate challenges and foster high performance.

## Tuckman's Stages of Team Development (Know These Cold!)

This model describes the common stages teams go through. It's cyclical and teams can regress.

1. **Forming**: The team is assembled. Members are polite, uncertain, and testing boundaries.
 * *PM's Role*: Define goals, roles, and provide clear direction. Facilitate introductions.
2. **Storming**: Conflict and tension emerge. Personalities clash, power struggles occur, and assumptions are challenged. This is where most teams fail.
 * *PM's Role*: Facilitate conflict resolution, encourage open communication, reinforce ground rules (from Team Charter). Build psychological safety.
3. **Norming**: The team develops cohesion. Roles clarify, trust builds, and ground rules are accepted. Consensus forms.
 * *PM's Role*: Step back, empower the team, facilitate decision-making, celebrate progress.
4. **Performing**: The team operates as a high-performing unit. They are interdependent, solve problems autonomously, and focus on achieving goals.
 * *PM's Role*: Delegate, provide resources, remove impediments, defend the team.
5. **Adjourning**: The project ends, and the team disbands. Emotional ties may be strong.
 * *PM's Role*: Celebrate achievements, recognize contributions, facilitate knowledge transfer, manage transitions.

::: warning Exam Insight: Regression
Teams can regress to earlier stages if:
* New members join.
* The team loses a key member.
* There's a significant change in project scope or goals.
* Unresolved conflict re-emerges.
The PM's job is to recognize regression and help the team move forward.

## Psychological Safety: The Core of High Performance

As identified by Google's Project Aristotle, psychological safety is the most critical factor for team success. Without it, team members won't speak up, experiment, or take necessary risks.

* **Definition**: A shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.
* **Key Indicators**:
 * Team members feel comfortable admitting mistakes.
 * They are willing to ask "dumb" questions.
 * They offer ideas, even if unpopular.
 * They provide constructive feedback to peers.
 * They challenge the status quo respectfully.

* **PM's Role in Fostering Psychological Safety**:
 * **Model Vulnerability**: Admit your own mistakes.
 * **Frame Work as Learning**: Emphasize experimentation and growth mindset.
 * **Invite Participation**: Explicitly ask quieter members for their input.
 * **Respond Constructively**: React positively to bad news or mistakes; don't shoot the messenger.
 * **Promote Open Dialogue**: Encourage respectful debate and diverse opinions.

## Team Performance Assessments

Regularly assessing team performance helps identify areas for improvement and celebrate successes.

* **Quantitative Metrics**:
 * **Velocity (Agile)**: Amount of work a team can complete in a sprint.
 * **Defect Density**: Number of defects per unit of code/feature.
 * **Burn-down/Burn-up Charts**: Track progress against planned work.
 * **On-time Delivery**: Percentage of tasks/deliverables completed by deadline.
* **Qualitative Metrics (often gathered via surveys, retrospectives, 1-on-1s)**:
 * **Team Cohesion**: How well team members work together.
 * **Communication Effectiveness**: Clarity and frequency of information exchange.
 * **Problem-Solving Capability**: How effectively the team resolves issues.
 * **Conflict Management**: How constructively the team handles disagreements.
 * **Satisfaction/Morale**: General happiness and engagement of team members.

## Tools & Techniques for Team Development

* **Team Building Activities**: From informal social events to formal workshops. Focus on building relationships and collaboration.
* **Training & Mentoring**: Address skill gaps and foster continuous learning (see 3.2b Coaching & Mentoring).
* **Feedback Mechanisms**: Regular 1-on-1s, 360-degree feedback, peer reviews.
* **Recognition & Rewards**: Acknowledge contributions and motivate performance (see 3.4 Motivation).
* **Decision-Making Models**: Empowering the team to make decisions (see 3.1c Team Charter).
* **Retrospectives (Agile)**: Regular sessions for teams to inspect and adapt their processes.
* **Conflict Resolution**: Facilitating healthy resolution of disagreements (see 3.3 Conflict Management).

::: tip Exam Mindset
The PM is a facilitator of team development, not a dictator. The goal is to create an environment where the team can self-organize, resolve its own issues, and continuously improve.

## Servant Leadership & Empowerment

High-performing teams thrive under servant leadership, where the PM focuses on serving the needs of the team.

* **Empowerment**: Giving the team authority and accountability for their work.
 * *PM's Role*: Delegate decision-making, remove impediments, provide necessary resources.
* **Trust Building**: Demonstrate reliability, integrity, and competence.
 * *PM's Role*: Be transparent, keep promises, be consistent.
* **Continuous Improvement**: Encourage experimentation and learning from failures.
 * *PM's Role*: Facilitate retrospectives, support innovation.
