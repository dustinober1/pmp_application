# Chapter 3: Team Leadership & Development

In 2026, leading a project isn't about "command and control"—it's about orchestrating diverse, scattered, and sometimes robotic talent toward a shared vision.

The People domain constitutes 42% of the PMP exam, emphasizing that the ability to resolve conflict is more critical than technical skills like calculating EVM.

## 2026 Mindset: The "Servant PM"

### Core Principles
*   **Don't Direct, Support**: Ask "What do you need?" instead of "Why isn't this done?".
*   **Don't Blame, Learn**: Retrospectives are for process improvement, not finger-pointing.
*   **Don't Ignore, Engage**: Conflict is healthy if it's task-based. Emotional conflict must be defused proactively.
