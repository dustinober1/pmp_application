## Impediment / Blocker Triage (60-Second Checklist)

Use this when a blocker surfaces during a standup or checkpoint:

1. **Clarify**: What is blocked and what is the smallest next step?
2. **Impact**: Who is blocked and for how long? What deliverable is at risk?
3. **Owner**: Who can fix it (team, vendor, functional manager, IT)?
4. **Escalation path**: Who has authority if the owner can’t resolve quickly?
5. **Decision**: What do you need (access, approval, funding, priority change)?
6. **Follow-up**: When will you check back (today, not next week)?

## Change Request “Mini-Analysis” (Fast Template)

Use for predictive change control, or for hybrid governance decisions.

| Field                    | Example                                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Request**              | Add SSO login option                             |
| **Reason**               | Security requirement from IT governance          |
| **Options**              | (A) Add now (B) Add next release (C) Defer       |
| **Impact summary**       | +2 weeks, +$30k, adds security testing           |
| **Risks created**        | Integration risk; vendor dependency              |
| **Recommendation**       | Add now; request schedule/budget change approval |
| **Decision needed from** | Sponsor/CCB                                      |
| **Decision date**        | 2026-02-01                                       |

::: info PMP nuance
In agile delivery, “change” often means **backlog re-prioritization**. In predictive delivery, it often means **formal integrated change control**. In hybrid, you may do both.

## RAID Log (Risks, Actions, Issues, Decisions)

RAID is a simple “single source of truth” for execution.

| Type         | What it captures                              | Example                                 |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Risk**     | Uncertain event                               | Vendor may miss delivery date           |
| **Action**   | Planned work to reduce risk / improve outcome | Run pilot with 10 users                 |
| **Issue**    | Current problem                               | Test environment unstable               |
| **Decision** | A recorded choice and rationale               | Choose AWS over Azure due to compliance |

::: tip Exam shortcut
When a scenario has confusion and rework, it’s usually missing a **decision log** (people keep re-litigating old decisions).

## Lessons Learned Register (Lightweight Template)

Capture lessons weekly (or each sprint). Keep it short and usable.

| Field                | Example                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Date / iteration** | Sprint 4                                         |
| **What happened**    | Defects spiked after a rushed merge              |
| **Root cause**       | DoD didn’t require peer review for hotfixes      |
| **Impact**           | Rework + delayed demo                            |
| **Lesson**           | Hotfixes must still follow minimum quality gates |
| **Action**           | Update DoD; add “hotfix checklist”               |
| **Owner**            | Tech lead                                        |
| **Status**           | Open / Done                                      |

## One-Page Status Report (Template)

Use this structure for executives and busy stakeholders:

- **Overall status**: Green / Yellow / Red (with 1-sentence reason)
- **This period**: Key accomplishments
- **Next period**: Top planned work
- **Risks**: Top 3 (owner + response)
- **Issues**: Top 3 (owner + next action)
- **Decisions needed**: 1–3 items (deadline + options)
- **Value signal**: Adoption/usage, demo feedback, defect trend (pick what matters)

---

## Transition to Operations (Operational Readiness Checklist)

Use before go-live/handoff to keep value from collapsing after delivery.

- **People**: Training complete, champions/support staffed, roles/RACI confirmed
- **Process**: SOPs updated, escalation path defined, SLAs agreed, incident process ready
- **Technology**: Monitoring/alerts set, backups/rollback plan, access/provisioning ready
- **Knowledge**: Runbooks + troubleshooting docs available, known issues documented
- **Benefits**: Benefits owner confirmed, measurement cadence scheduled

---

## Escalation Message (Copy/Paste)

Use when a blocker needs fast action and you want to be clear and respectful.

**Subject**: Blocker impacting delivery (decision needed by \<date/time\>)

**Context**: \<brief description\>
**Impact**: \<who is blocked / what milestone is at risk\>
**Requested action**: \<what you need from them\>
**Options**: \<if applicable\>
**Decision deadline**: \<date/time\>
**Owner / follow-up**: \<name + when you'll follow up\>

## Stakeholder Engagement Assessment (Quick Template)

Use to diagnose engagement issues and plan corrective action.

| Field                        | Your Assessment                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stakeholder name / group** | e.g., Operations VP                                                             |
| **Current engagement level** | Unaware / Resistant / Neutral / Supportive / Leading                            |
| **Desired engagement level** | Supportive / Leading                                                            |
| **Gap / issue**              | Concerned about workload on their team                                          |
| **Root cause**               | Not involved in planning; surprised by timeline                                 |
| **Strategy**                 | Meet 1:1; listen to concerns; adjust transition plan; involve in sprint reviews |
| **Next action**              | Schedule 30-min meeting this week                                               |
| **Owner**                    | PM                                                                              |
| **Follow-up date**           | Weekly check-in                                                                 |

::: tip Exam shortcut
If a stakeholder becomes resistant during execution, the best first move is usually **active listening** (understand their concern) before trying to "sell" them on the project.

## Communication Methods Comparison (Quick Reference)

Choose the right channel for the situation.

| Method                 | When to use                             | Strengths                      | Weaknesses                     | Exam context                  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| **Face-to-face**       | Conflict, bad news, complex negotiation | Highest richness; builds trust | Time-intensive; not scalable   | Best for sensitive issues     |
| **Video call**         | Distributed teams; urgent alignment     | Visual cues; real-time         | Timezone challenges; fatigue   | Good for virtual teams        |
| **Phone call**         | Urgent clarification; quick decision    | Fast; personal                 | No visual; no record           | Use when email is too slow    |
| **Email**              | Status updates; formal record           | Documented; asynchronous       | Misinterpretation risk; delays | Good for audit trail          |
| **Chat / IM**          | Quick questions; team coordination      | Fast; informal                 | No record; interrupts flow     | Use sparingly in execution    |
| **Dashboard / portal** | Ongoing metrics; self-service data      | Always available; visual       | Requires maintenance           | Good for transparent progress |

::: info PMP nuance
**Interactive communication** (meetings, calls) is best for complex issues. **Push communication** (email, reports) is best for distributing information. **Pull communication** (dashboards, wikis) is best for self-service access.
:::

## Conflict Resolution Approaches (PMP Reference)

The exam tests which approach fits the situation.

| Approach                        | Description                                                          | When to use                                                      | Exam keyword                            | Sustainability                |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Collaborate / Problem-solve** | Work together to find a win-win solution that satisfies both parties | High-stakes; long-term relationships; creative options available | "Best approach"; "Permanent solution"   | High (addresses root cause)   |
| **Compromise**                  | Each party gives up something to reach middle ground                 | Time pressure; equal power; moderate importance                  | "Split the difference"; "Meet halfway"  | Medium (partial satisfaction) |
| **Accommodate / Smooth**        | Yield to the other party to preserve harmony                         | Low importance to you; preserve relationship; you were wrong     | "Keep the peace"; "Let it go"           | Medium (may build resentment) |
| **Force / Direct**              | Impose a solution using authority or power                           | Emergency; safety risk; low importance to others                 | "Make a decision"; "Use authority"      | Low (builds resentment)       |
| **Withdraw / Avoid**            | Postpone or sidestep the conflict                                    | Cooling-off period needed; trivial issue; no chance of winning   | "Table the discussion"; "Revisit later" | Low (conflict may escalate)   |

::: tip Exam shortcut
The exam usually favors **Collaborate** for team conflicts (win-win, addresses root cause). Use **Force** only for emergencies or when you have clear authority and the stakes are high.

## Vendor Management Checklist (During Execution)

Use to ensure procurement stays on track.

- [ ] **Contract clarity**: All parties understand scope, deliverables, acceptance criteria, payment terms
- [ ] **Communication cadence**: Regular status meetings scheduled (weekly or per contract terms)
- [ ] **Performance tracking**: Monitor against SLAs, milestones, quality standards
- [ ] **Issue log**: Track vendor-related issues separately; escalate per contract
- [ ] **Change control**: All scope changes go through formal procurement change process
- [ ] **Payment milestone tracking**: Tie payments to verified deliverables (not just time)
- [ ] **Relationship management**: Build trust; treat as partner (not adversary)
- [ ] **Risk monitoring**: Watch for vendor financial issues, resource turnover, dependency risks
- [ ] **Documentation**: Keep records of all decisions, changes, and acceptance
- [ ] **Dispute resolution**: Use ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution) before litigation

| **Purpose / Vision** | [What this team exists to accomplish]          |
| **Success Measures** | [How we'll know we're succeeding - OKRs, KPIs] |

### Team Members & Roles

| Name   | Role          | Key Responsibilities                                   | Availability    |

### Working Agreements

- [ ] **Core hours**: [e.g., 10am-3pm EST everyone available]
- [ ] **Communication preference**: [e.g., Slack for urgent, email for FYI]
- [ ] **Meeting norms**: [e.g., cameras on, start on time, 5-min late = recap provided]
- [ ] **Decision-making**: [e.g., consent-based, majority vote, PM decides if stuck]
- [ ] **Conflict resolution**: [e.g., address directly first, then escalate to SM/PM]
- [ ] **Definition of Done**: [e.g., coded, tested, reviewed, documented, demoed]

### Ground Rules & Values

| Value            | Behavior                                                      |

| **Quality**      | Don't cut corners; review thoroughly; automate where possible |
| **Improvement**  | Learn from mistakes; celebrate wins; always get better        |

::: tip Exam Application
Team charters establish **clear expectations** and **working agreements** at kickoff. If a scenario describes team confusion about roles or conflict about how to work, the answer often involves **creating or revisiting the team charter**.

## Sprint Planning Checklist

Use to ensure effective sprint planning meetings.

### Before Sprint Planning

- [ ] **Product Backlog groomed**: Top items refined, estimated, and prioritized
- [ ] **Velocity known**: Team knows their average capacity from past sprints
- [ ] **Definition of Ready met**: Stories have acceptance criteria, estimates, and are clear
- [ ] **Stakeholder availability**: PO and key stakeholders available for questions
- [ ] **Technical constraints identified**: Dependencies, environments, tools confirmed

### During Sprint Planning

- [ ] **Sprint Goal defined**: One clear objective for the sprint (not just a list of items)
- [ ] **Team selects work**: Team pulls stories (not PM/PO assigning)
- [ ] **Capacity discussed**: Account for vacations, meetings, other commitments
- [ ] **Stories decomposed**: Break items into tasks (max 1 day each)
- [ ] **Dependencies identified**: Note any external dependencies or handoffs
- [ ] **Risks discussed**: What could block us this sprint?
- [ ] **Team commits**: Team agrees they can deliver the selected scope

### After Sprint Planning

- [ ] **Sprint Backlog visible**: All items and tasks on the board
- [ ] **Sprint Goal posted**: Visible to team and stakeholders
- [ ] **First day's work clear**: Everyone knows what to start tomorrow
- [ ] **Retrospective scheduled**: End of sprint meeting on calendar

::: warning Anti-Pattern Alert
If sprint planning takes too long (>4 hours for 2-week sprint) or ends without a clear sprint goal, the team lacks backlog refinement practices. The fix is **better grooming before planning**, not longer planning meetings.
:::

| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Low user adoption   | B-001, B-003 may not be realized   | Training program, adoption incentives |
| Data quality issues | B-002 can't be measured accurately | Data cleansing, validation checks     |

::: tip Exam Insight
Benefits are often realized **after project closure**. The PM's role during execution is to ensure the project is set up for benefit realization by tracking leading indicators, ensuring adoption, and documenting the benefits measurement approach.

## Risk Response Execution Checklist

Use when a risk trigger occurs and you need to execute the planned response.

### Step 1: Confirm Trigger

- [ ] Verify the risk has actually occurred (not just a similar event)
- [ ] Confirm the trigger matches what was defined in the Risk Register
- [ ] Document the actual trigger conditions

### Step 2: Execute Response

- [ ] Retrieve the risk response plan from the Risk Register
- [ ] Execute the planned response immediately (avoid delays)
- [ ] If planned response isn't possible, escalate for alternative decision
- [ ] Document actions taken with timestamps

### Step 3: Convert to Issue

- [ ] Create an Issue Log entry (Issue ID, description, date, owner)
- [ ] Update Risk Register: Mark as "Occurred" or close the risk
- [ ] Link the Issue to the original Risk for traceability

### Step 4: Assess Actual Impact

- [ ] Compare actual impact to planned impact
- [ ] If impact exceeds contingency reserve, prepare change request
- [ ] Identify any secondary risks created by the response

### Step 5: Communicate

- [ ] Notify stakeholders per the Communications Plan
- [ ] Provide: What happened, actions taken, current status, next steps
- [ ] Update status reports and dashboards

### Step 6: Capture Lessons

- [ ] What worked in the response? What didn't?
- [ ] Was the risk correctly assessed? Was the response effective?
- [ ] Update Lessons Learned Register
- [ ] Recommend process improvements if needed

::: tip Exam Shortcut
If a risk occurs, your FIRST action is **execute the pre-planned response**, not "analyze the situation" or "create a new plan." Risk planning exists precisely for this moment.

## Virtual Team Management Checklist

Use for distributed, remote, or hybrid teams to maintain productivity and cohesion.

### Communication Setup

- [ ] **Primary video platform confirmed** (Zoom, Teams, Meet)
- [ ] **Backup communication channel available** (phone, alternate platform)
- [ ] **Async communication tool agreed** (Slack, Teams, email)
- [ ] **Project board visible to all** (Jira, Trello, Azure DevOps)
- [ ] **Shared documentation repository** (Confluence, SharePoint, Notion)

### Time Zone Management

- [ ] **Team timezone overlay created** (World Time Buddy, shared calendar)
- [ ] **Core overlap hours identified** (when everyone can meet)
- [ ] **Meeting rotation schedule** (fair distribution across time zones)
- [ ] **Async-first default** (minimize meetings, maximize documentation)

### Communication Cadence

- [ ] **Daily standup scheduled** (video on; consistent time or rotating)
- [ ] **Weekly team sync** (longer agenda; blockers, priorities, demos)
- [ ] **1-on-1s scheduled** (every 1-2 weeks with each team member)
- [ ] **Retrospectives scheduled** (end of each sprint/phase)

### Trust Building Activities

- [ ] **Virtual team-building scheduled** (not just work; social connection)
- [ ] **Personal check-ins incorporated** (brief "how are you?" in meetings)
- [ ] **Recognition rituals established** (kudos channel, celebration of wins)
- [ ] **Informal channels created** (virtual coffee, non-work chat)

### Meeting Effectiveness

- [ ] **Agenda shared in advance** (no surprise topics)
- [ ] **Video default for all meetings** (cameras on when feasible)
- [ ] **Engagement techniques used** (polls, reactions, call on quiet members)
- [ ] **Meetings recorded** (for async viewers in other time zones)
- [ ] **Action items captured** (who, what, when—before ending)

### Onboarding New Virtual Team Members

- [ ] **Welcome video call scheduled** (meet the team)
- [ ] **Documentation shared** (project context, decisions, culture)
- [ ] **Buddy/mentor assigned** (connection for questions)
- [ ] **Tool access verified** (all platforms, repos, boards)
- [ ] **Early 1-on-1 with PM** (check-in after first week)

### Monitoring Engagement

- [ ] **Participation tracked** (who is quieter than usual?)
- [ ] **1-on-1 pulse checks** (ask about blockers, workload, morale)
- [ ] **Action on silence** (reach out to disengaged team members)
- [ ] **Retrospective feedback reviewed** (trends in team health)

::: warning Virtual Team Red Flags
Watch for: Cameras always off, declining response times, reduced meeting participation, isolation patterns. Don't assume "no news is good news"—proactively check in.

## Value Delivery Assessment (Fast Checklist)

Use during execution to ensure the project is on track to deliver value (not just outputs).

| Question                                                                   | Status | Notes / Action |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | -------------- |
| **Output**: Are we producing the planned deliverables?                     | / /    |                |
| **Outcome**: Will users actually adopt the solution?                       | / /    |                |
| **Benefit**: Can we measure the expected improvement?                      | / /    |                |
| **Leading indicators**: Are usage/training/feedback signals positive?      | / /    |                |
| **Stakeholder validation**: Do users confirm this solves their problem?    | / /    |                |
| **Operational readiness**: Is operations prepared to sustain the solution? | / /    |                |
| **Benefits owner**: Is someone accountable for post-delivery value?        | / /    |                |

**If you have multiple or **: Stop and re-align with stakeholders. Meeting the schedule means nothing if the value won't materialize.

## Servant Leadership Checklist (Daily Execution)

Use to stay focused on removing impediments and enabling the team.

**Daily / Standup Focus:**

- [ ] What blockers exist today? (Identify impediments)
- [ ] Who can remove each blocker? (Assign owners)
- [ ] What resources/decisions does the team need? (Provide support)
- [ ] Are priorities still correct? (Adjust if value shifts)
- [ ] Is anyone overloaded or context-switching? (Protect focus)

**Weekly / Checkpoint Focus:**

- [ ] Are there systemic blockers? (Process, tools, access, policies)
- [ ] What feedback have we received? (User demos, retrospectives)
- [ ] What lessons have we learned? (Update lessons learned register)
- [ ] Do stakeholders have what they need? (Proactive communication)
- [ ] Is the team motivated and healthy? (Morale, conflict, workload)

**Sprint / Phase Focus:**

- [ ] Did we deliver value? (Outcomes, not just outputs)
- [ ] What will we improve next? (Retrospective actions)
- [ ] Is operational readiness progressing? (Training, docs, support)
- [ ] Are dependencies with other teams clear? (Coordination)

::: tip Exam shortcut
Servant leadership means **the team's success is your success**. If they're blocked, your job is to clear the path—not micromanage their work.

## Knowledge Management Methods (Quick Reference)

The exam tests how you capture and share knowledge.

| Knowledge Type               | Examples                             | Capture Method                              | Share Method                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Explicit** (codified)      | Code, blueprints, processes, manuals | Documentation, repositories, templates      | Wiki, SharePoint, training materials      |
| **Tacit** (experience-based) | "Know-how," judgment, intuition      | Pair programming, shadowing, retrospectives | Communities of practice, mentoring, demos |

### Knowledge capture during execution

- **Lessons Learned Register**: Update weekly (not just at project end)
- **Decision Log**: Record why you chose option A over B (prevents re-litigation)
- **Retrospectives**: Turn team feedback into actionable improvements
- **Demos / Show-and-tell**: Share tacit knowledge through demonstration
- **After-action reviews**: Quick debrief after incidents or milestones

::: info PMP nuance
Tacit knowledge is best transferred through **social interaction** (pairing, collaboration, communities). Don't just write a manual and expect people to learn complex judgment.

## Quality Tools Reference (Execution Context)

Use these tools to prevent and detect defects.

| Tool                                       | What it does                                  | When to use                                         | Example                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition of Done (DoD)**               | Checklist of requirements for "complete" work | Every user story, task, or deliverable              | "Unit tests pass, code reviewed, docs updated, no critical bugs"          |
| **Peer review / Code review**              | Team member inspects work before acceptance   | Before merging code or finalizing deliverables      | Pull request review, design review                                        |
| **Checklist**                              | Simple list of steps to ensure consistency    | Repetitive tasks (deployments, testing, onboarding) | Pre-flight checklist, release checklist                                   |
| **Root cause analysis (5 Whys, Fishbone)** | Identify underlying cause of defects          | After recurring issues or major defects             | "Why did the deployment fail? Because tests weren't run. Why? Because..." |
| **Test-driven development (TDD)**          | Write tests before code to prevent defects    | High-risk or complex logic                          | Unit tests, acceptance tests                                              |
| **Continuous integration (CI)**            | Automated build + test on every commit        | Prevent integration defects                         | Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CircleCI                                         |

::: tip Exam shortcut
**Prevention** (peer reviews, DoD, checklists) is better than **detection** (testing, inspection). Agile favors built-in quality over end-of-phase inspection.

## Decision Tree: Impediment Escalation

Use this decision flow when a blocker surfaces.

```
START: Team member is blocked

 → Can the TEAM remove it immediately?
 YES → Remove it now → Update impediment log → DONE
 NO → Continue

 → Can the PM remove it (within authority)?
 YES → Take action → Update issue log → Follow up → DONE
 NO → Continue

 → Is it a functional manager / resource issue?
 YES → Escalate to functional manager → Set deadline → Follow up daily → DONE
 NO → Continue

 → Is it a vendor / external dependency?
 YES → Check contract → Escalate per contract terms → Log issue → DONE
 NO → Continue

 → Is it a policy / process / tool issue?
 YES → Escalate to PMO / operations → Request exception or change → DONE
 NO → Continue

 → Escalate to SPONSOR (authority needed)
 Present: Problem + Impact + Options + Recommendation → Decision → DONE
```

**Key principle**: Don't wait. Escalate fast, follow up relentlessly.

---

## Decision Tree: Change Request Triage (Predictive)

Use when a stakeholder requests a change to scope/schedule/cost.

```
START: Change request received

 → Is it INSIDE current scope (clarification, not change)?
 YES → Clarify with stakeholder → Execute as planned → Update docs → DONE
 NO → Continue (it's a real change)

 → Does it impact baselines (scope/schedule/cost/quality)?
 NO → Log as minor issue → Execute → Update project docs → DONE
 YES → Continue (requires formal analysis)

 → Perform integrated impact analysis:
 Scope impact (deliverables affected)
 Schedule impact (critical path, milestones)
 Cost impact (labor, materials, vendor)
 Quality impact (testing, acceptance criteria)
 Risk impact (new risks created)
 Generate options (approve / defer / reject / modify)

 → Does PM have approval authority for this impact level?
 YES → Make decision → Update baselines → Communicate → DONE
 NO → Continue (needs CCB approval)

 → Submit to CCB (Change Control Board):
 Present: Request + Impact analysis + Options + Recommendation
 CCB Decision: Approved / Rejected / Deferred

 APPROVED → Update baselines → Update change log → Communicate → Execute → DONE
 REJECTED → Update change log → Communicate to requester → DONE
 DEFERRED → Log for future consideration → Communicate → DONE
```

**Key principle**: Always analyze impact before deciding. Never "quietly" change baselines.

---

## Decision Tree: Value Delivery Risk (Hybrid/Agile)

Use when you sense the project is at risk of delivering outputs without outcomes.

```
START: Concern about value delivery

 → Are users/stakeholders engaged in validating the work?
 NO → Schedule demo / review → Get feedback → Adjust priorities → Re-engage
 YES → Continue

 → Are we measuring leading indicators (usage, adoption, feedback)?
 NO → Define metrics → Start tracking → Review weekly → Adjust
 YES → Continue

 → Are leading indicators positive?
 NO → Investigate root cause → Re-validate with users → Pivot if needed
 YES → Continue

 → Is operational readiness progressing (training, support, docs)?
 NO → Accelerate transition planning → Assign owners → Track → Escalate gaps
 YES → Continue

 → Is there a benefits owner accountable for post-delivery value?
 NO → Identify owner → Confirm metrics → Schedule benefits reviews → DONE
 YES → Continue

 → Is the benefits owner aligned on success criteria?
 NO → Re-align on outcomes → Adjust acceptance criteria → DONE
 YES → Continue delivering → Monitor value signals → DONE
```

**Key principle**: Value delivery requires continuous validation. Don't wait until go-live to discover users won't adopt.

## Flowchart: Work Performance Data → Information → Reports

```

 WORK PERFORMANCE DATA
 (Raw observations)
 - Task completion %
 - Defect counts
 - Test pass/fail
 - Hours logged
 - Story points completed


 ↓ ANALYZE (Add context + meaning)


 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATION
 (Analyzed insights)
 - Schedule variance (SV = EV - PV)
 - Cost variance (CV = EV - AC)
 - Defect trend (increasing/stable)
 - Velocity trend (sprint over sprint)
 - Root cause themes


 ↓ PACKAGE (For audience + purpose)


 WORK PERFORMANCE REPORTS
 (Tailored communication)
 - Executive dashboard (traffic light)
 - Stakeholder status report (1-pager)
 - Steering committee deck
 - Team burndown chart

```

**Key principle**: Data alone is noise. Convert it to insight, then communicate to the right audience.

---

## EVM During Execution (Monitoring Example)

Use EVM to detect variances early and forecast final outcomes.

### Scenario

You're in Month 4 of a 10-month project. Here's the current status:

- **Budget at Completion (BAC)**: $500,000
- **Planned Value (PV)**: $200,000 (should have spent by now)
- **Actual Cost (AC)**: $220,000 (actually spent)
- **Earned Value (EV)**: $180,000 (value of work completed)

### Calculate Performance

| Metric                               | Formula | Calculation   | Result    | Meaning                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ------- | ------------- | --------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Schedule Variance (SV)**           | EV - PV | $180k - $200k | **-$20k** | Behind schedule              |
| **Cost Variance (CV)**               | EV - AC | $180k - $220k | **-$40k** | Over budget                  |
| **Schedule Performance Index (SPI)** | EV ÷ PV | $180k ÷ $200k | **0.90**  | 90% efficient (slow)         |
| **Cost Performance Index (CPI)**     | EV ÷ AC | $180k ÷ $220k | **0.82**  | 82% efficient (overspending) |

### Forecast Final Outcomes

| Metric                                   | Formula                 | Calculation                       | Result        | Meaning                                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Estimate at Completion (EAC)**         | BAC ÷ CPI               | $500k ÷ 0.82                      | **$609,756**  | Final cost forecast                        |
| **Estimate to Complete (ETC)**           | EAC - AC                | $609,756 - $220k                  | **$389,756**  | Cost to finish                             |
| **Variance at Completion (VAC)**         | BAC - EAC               | $500k - $609,756                  | **-$109,756** | Over budget at end                         |
| **To-Complete Performance Index (TCPI)** | (BAC - EV) ÷ (BAC - AC) | ($500k - $180k) ÷ ($500k - $220k) | **1.14**      | Must be 114% efficient to finish on budget |

### Interpretation & Action

- **Red flag**: CPI = 0.82 means we're overspending significantly
- **Red flag**: TCPI = 1.14 means we need to be **more efficient going forward** than we've been historically (unlikely)
- **Action**: Present to sponsor → Request budget increase OR reduce scope → Update baselines

::: warning Common Exam Trap
If **CPI < 1.0** and **TCPI > 1.0**, the project is unlikely to finish on budget without corrective action (scope reduction, efficiency improvement, or budget increase).

## Value Metrics Tracking (Leading Indicators)

Use during execution to predict whether value will materialize.

| Metric Type               | Example Metrics                                     | What it predicts            | Target / Threshold                    |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Adoption signals**      | % users trained, % users activated, demo attendance | Will users actually use it? | >80% trained before go-live           |
| **Engagement signals**    | Active users, feature usage %, session length       | Are users finding value?    | >50% adoption in first 30 days        |
| **Feedback signals**      | NPS score, satisfaction surveys, support tickets    | Are users satisfied?        | NPS >30, satisfaction >4/5            |
| **Quality signals**       | Defect density, test pass rate, escaped defects     | Will it work reliably?      | <5 defects per release                |
| **Operational readiness** | Runbook completion, support staffing, SLA readiness | Can operations sustain it?  | 100% complete 2 weeks before go-live  |
| **Benefit metrics**       | Time saved, cost reduced, revenue increased         | Are outcomes happening?     | Meet baseline targets within 3 months |

**Example**: If only 40% of users are trained 1 week before go-live, **value is at risk**. Action: Delay go-live OR accept partial adoption.

| **Stakeholder wants change**                   | Say "yes" or "no"             | Assess impact → follow change process               | Never change baselines informally      |
| **Defect found in production**                 | Blame someone                 | Fix → root cause analysis → prevent recurrence      | Focus on the system, not the person    |
| **Users unhappy despite meeting requirements** | Defend the requirements       | Re-engage users → validate outcomes                 | Requirements are a means, not the end  |
| **Vendor underperforming**                     | Threaten them                 | Check contract → escalate per terms → ADR if needed | Contract is the rulebook               |
| **Team conflict**                              | Ignore it or force a solution | Facilitate collaboration (win-win)                  | Collaborate addresses root cause       |
| **Operations won't accept handoff**            | Force go-live anyway          | Close readiness gaps (training, docs, support)      | Value collapses without adoption       |
| **Schedule slipping**                          | Work overtime                 | Analyze root cause → adjust plan OR scope           | Sustainable pace; fix the system       |
| **Stakeholder disengaged**                     | Send more emails              | Meet 1:1 → listen → re-engage                       | Active listening builds support        |

## EVM Formula Quick Reference (Execution Context)

### Core Metrics

| Formula           | What it tells you                         | Good =   | Bad =    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| **SV = EV - PV**  | Schedule variance (dollars behind/ahead)  | Positive | Negative |
| **CV = EV - AC**  | Cost variance (dollars under/over budget) | Positive | Negative |
| **SPI = EV ÷ PV** | Schedule efficiency (pace)                | > 1.0    | < 1.0    |
| **CPI = EV ÷ AC** | Cost efficiency (spending)                | > 1.0    | < 1.0    |

### Forecasting

| Formula                                   | What it tells you                                          | When to use                               |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **EAC = BAC ÷ CPI**                       | Forecast final cost (assumes current efficiency continues) | Most common exam formula                  |
| **EAC = AC + BAC - EV**                   | Forecast final cost (assumes remaining work on plan)       | When current variances are atypical       |
| **EAC = AC + [(BAC - EV) ÷ (CPI × SPI)]** | Forecast final cost (considers both cost and schedule)     | When both cost and schedule matter        |
| **ETC = EAC - AC**                        | Cost to complete remaining work                            | Planning remaining budget                 |
| **VAC = BAC - EAC**                       | Variance at completion (over/under budget at end)          | Reporting to sponsor                      |
| **TCPI = (BAC - EV) ÷ (BAC - AC)**        | Efficiency needed to finish on budget                      | Determining if budget target is realistic |
| **TCPI = (BAC - EV) ÷ (EAC - AC)**        | Efficiency needed to finish at EAC                         | When you've accepted a new budget (EAC)   |

### Interpretation Cheat Sheet

| Condition                   | Interpretation                         | Likely action                           |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **CPI < 1.0**               | Overspending                           | Request budget increase OR reduce scope |
| **SPI < 1.0**               | Behind schedule                        | Fast-track OR crash OR reduce scope     |
| **TCPI > 1.0**              | Need higher efficiency than historical | Unlikely to meet budget without change  |
| **CPI > 1.0 AND SPI > 1.0** | Ahead of plan (rare!)                  | Continue; watch for scope creep         |
| **VAC < 0**                 | Will finish over budget                | Escalate to sponsor; request change     |

## Communication Model Quick Reference

### Communication Formula

**Channels = n(n-1) ÷ 2**

- Where n = number of stakeholders
- Example: 10 stakeholders = 10(9) ÷ 2 = **45 communication channels**

### Communication Methods (Push / Pull / Interactive)

| Method                      | Type        | Example             | Best for                            |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Email, memo, report**     | Push        | Status report       | Documented updates; audit trail     |
| **Wiki, portal, dashboard** | Pull        | SharePoint, Jira    | Self-service; always-available data |
| **Meeting, call, video**    | Interactive | Daily standup, demo | Complex issues; real-time feedback  |

### Effective Listening

- **Active listening**: Focus, summarize, confirm understanding, ask questions
- **Empathetic listening**: Understand emotions and concerns (not just words)
- **Remove barriers**: Noise, distractions, language, jargon, assumptions

## Team Performance & Development Quick Reference

### Tuckman's Team Development Stages

| Stage          | Behavior                                  | PM Action                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |

| **Storming**   | Conflict, competing ideas, resistance     | Facilitate collaboration; address conflict directly |
| **Norming**    | Cooperation, shared norms, trust building | Encourage; reinforce positive behaviors             |
| **Performing** | High trust, self-organizing, productive   | Delegate; remove impediments; celebrate wins        |
| **Adjourning** | Closure, transition, saying goodbye       | Celebrate achievements; capture lessons learned     |

### Motivation Theories (Exam Context)

| Theory                    | Core idea                                                                                                          | Application                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Maslow's Hierarchy**    | People have levels of needs (physiological → safety → social → esteem → self-actualization)                        | Ensure basic needs are met before expecting high performance  |
| **Herzberg's Two-Factor** | Hygiene factors (salary, safety) prevent dissatisfaction; motivators (achievement, recognition) drive satisfaction | Fix hygiene issues; add motivators for engagement             |
| **McGregor's Theory X/Y** | Theory X: People avoid work (need control). Theory Y: People seek responsibility (need autonomy)                   | Use Theory Y approach (trust, empowerment) for knowledge work |
| **Vroom's Expectancy**    | Motivation = Expectancy × Instrumentality × Valence                                                                | Clarify that effort → performance → valuable reward           |

## Power & Influence Quick Reference

### Types of Power

| Type                    | Source                   | Example                       | Sustainability                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Formal / Legitimate** | Position, title          | "I'm the PM"                  | Medium (only within authority) |
| **Reward**              | Ability to give benefits | Bonuses, recognition          | Medium (limited by budget)     |
| **Penalty / Coercive**  | Ability to punish        | "Do this or else"             | Low (builds resentment)        |
| **Expert**              | Knowledge, skills        | "I know how to solve this"    | High (builds respect)          |
| **Referent**            | Charisma, respect        | "People want to work with me" | High (builds loyalty)          |

**Best practice**: Rely on **Expert** and **Referent** power (influence) over **Penalty** power (coercion).

## ADKAR Change Model (Adoption Quick Reference)

Use to diagnose why adoption is failing.

| Stage             | Question                                 | If NO, then...                                          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Awareness**     | Do people know WHY the change is needed? | Increase communication; explain business case           |
| **Desire**        | Do they WANT to support the change?      | Address concerns; emphasize WIIFM (What's In It For Me) |
| **Knowledge**     | Do they know HOW to change?              | Provide training, documentation, demos                  |
| **Ability**       | Can they actually DO it?                 | Provide practice, coaching, support, tools              |
| **Reinforcement** | Will they SUSTAIN the change?            | Celebrate wins, provide feedback, adjust incentives     |

**Exam pattern**: If operations resists handoff, strengthen **Knowledge** (training) and **Ability** (support, tools).

## Exam-Day Execution Mindset Summary

### The "Servant Leader" Lens

- **Impediment?** → Remove it or escalate immediately
- **Conflict?** → Facilitate collaboration (win-win)
- **Quality issue?** → Fix the system, not the person
- **Stakeholder unhappy?** → Listen first, then act
- **Value at risk?** → Re-engage users; validate outcomes

### The "Value First" Lens

- **Meeting requirements ≠ delivering value**
- **Outputs → Outcomes → Benefits → Value**
- **Measure leading indicators** (adoption, engagement, feedback)
- **Operational readiness is mandatory** (not optional)
- **Benefits owner is accountable** (not the PM after handoff)

### The "Governance" Lens

- **Change baselines?** → Follow formal change control
- **Vendor issue?** → Check contract first
- **Stakeholder issue?** → Check stakeholder engagement plan first
- **Communication issue?** → Check communications management plan first
- **Never "wing it"** → Use the plan, then update the plan
