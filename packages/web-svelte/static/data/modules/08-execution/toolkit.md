# 8.3 Tools & Templates (One-Stop Reference)

**ECO Task**: Remove impediments and manage issues

Use this page as a copy/paste toolkit for execution and value delivery scenarios. It’s designed to match how the PMP exam phrases problems (“what should you do first?”).

---

## 🧾 Issue Log (Copy/Paste Template)
Minimum fields that make issues actionable:

| Field | Example |
|---|---|
| **Issue ID** | I-023 |
| **Date raised** | 2026-01-12 |
| **Description** | Cloud environment access missing for 3 developers |
| **Type** | Impediment / Technical / Vendor / Stakeholder |
| **Impact (scope/schedule/cost/quality)** | Schedule: 2-day slip risk; Cost: idle time |
| **Urgency** | High |
| **Owner** | PM (or named resolver) |
| **Next action** | Escalate to infra lead; request same-day access |
| **Due date** | 2026-01-13 |
| **Status** | Open / In progress / Resolved / Closed |
| **Resolution summary** | Access granted; add onboarding checklist |
| **Related items** | Risk R-014, Change CR-005, Decision D-009 |

::: tip 💡 Exam shortcut
If the team is blocked, don’t “log and wait.” Log it, assign an owner, and **remove/escalate** the impediment immediately.
:::

## 🧱 Impediment / Blocker Triage (60-Second Checklist)
Use this when a blocker surfaces during a standup or checkpoint:

1. **Clarify**: What is blocked and what is the smallest next step?
2. **Impact**: Who is blocked and for how long? What deliverable is at risk?
3. **Owner**: Who can fix it (team, vendor, functional manager, IT)?
4. **Escalation path**: Who has authority if the owner can’t resolve quickly?
5. **Decision**: What do you need (access, approval, funding, priority change)?
6. **Follow-up**: When will you check back (today, not next week)?

---

## 🔁 Change Request “Mini-Analysis” (Fast Template)
Use for predictive change control, or for hybrid governance decisions.

| Field | Example |
|---|---|
| **Request** | Add SSO login option |
| **Reason** | Security requirement from IT governance |
| **Options** | (A) Add now (B) Add next release (C) Defer |
| **Impact summary** | +2 weeks, +$30k, adds security testing |
| **Risks created** | Integration risk; vendor dependency |
| **Recommendation** | Add now; request schedule/budget change approval |
| **Decision needed from** | Sponsor/CCB |
| **Decision date** | 2026-02-01 |

::: info 🔍 PMP nuance
In agile delivery, “change” often means **backlog re-prioritization**. In predictive delivery, it often means **formal integrated change control**. In hybrid, you may do both.
:::

---

## 📌 RAID Log (Risks, Actions, Issues, Decisions)
RAID is a simple “single source of truth” for execution.

| Type | What it captures | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Risk** | Uncertain event | Vendor may miss delivery date |
| **Action** | Planned work to reduce risk / improve outcome | Run pilot with 10 users |
| **Issue** | Current problem | Test environment unstable |
| **Decision** | A recorded choice and rationale | Choose AWS over Azure due to compliance |

::: tip 💡 Exam shortcut
When a scenario has confusion and rework, it’s usually missing a **decision log** (people keep re-litigating old decisions).
:::

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned Register (Lightweight Template)
Capture lessons weekly (or each sprint). Keep it short and usable.

| Field | Example |
|---|---|
| **Date / iteration** | Sprint 4 |
| **What happened** | Defects spiked after a rushed merge |
| **Root cause** | DoD didn’t require peer review for hotfixes |
| **Impact** | Rework + delayed demo |
| **Lesson** | Hotfixes must still follow minimum quality gates |
| **Action** | Update DoD; add “hotfix checklist” |
| **Owner** | Tech lead |
| **Status** | Open / Done |

---

## 🗓️ Execution Meeting Agendas (Ready-to-Use)

### Daily standup (15 minutes)
- What did we complete since last sync?
- What will we complete next?
- What is blocking us?
- Are priorities still correct?

### Weekly stakeholder status (15–30 minutes)
- Progress vs plan (high-level)
- Top risks/issues and what we’re doing
- Decisions needed (with options and impacts)
- Upcoming milestones/demo dates

### Sprint review / demo (30–60 minutes)
- Demo the increment (focus on outcomes)
- Confirm acceptance (Done or not Done)
- Capture feedback and backlog changes
- Align on release timing expectations

### Retrospective (30–60 minutes)
- What went well?
- What didn’t?
- What will we try next?
- What is the single most important improvement action?

---

## 📣 One-Page Status Report (Template)
Use this structure for executives and busy stakeholders:

- **Overall status**: Green / Yellow / Red (with 1-sentence reason)
- **This period**: Key accomplishments
- **Next period**: Top planned work
- **Risks**: Top 3 (owner + response)
- **Issues**: Top 3 (owner + next action)
- **Decisions needed**: 1–3 items (deadline + options)
- **Value signal**: Adoption/usage, demo feedback, defect trend (pick what matters)

---

## 🏁 Transition to Operations (Operational Readiness Checklist)
Use before go-live/handoff to keep value from collapsing after delivery.

- **People**: Training complete, champions/support staffed, roles/RACI confirmed
- **Process**: SOPs updated, escalation path defined, SLAs agreed, incident process ready
- **Technology**: Monitoring/alerts set, backups/rollback plan, access/provisioning ready
- **Knowledge**: Runbooks + troubleshooting docs available, known issues documented
- **Benefits**: Benefits owner confirmed, measurement cadence scheduled

---

## 🧭 Escalation Message (Copy/Paste)
Use when a blocker needs fast action and you want to be clear and respectful.

**Subject**: Blocker impacting delivery (decision needed by \<date/time\>)

**Context**: \<brief description\>
**Impact**: \<who is blocked / what milestone is at risk\>
**Requested action**: \<what you need from them\>
**Options**: \<if applicable\>
**Decision deadline**: \<date/time\>
**Owner / follow-up**: \<name + when you'll follow up\>

---

## 📞 Stakeholder Engagement Assessment (Quick Template)
Use to diagnose engagement issues and plan corrective action.

| Field | Your Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Stakeholder name / group** | e.g., Operations VP |
| **Current engagement level** | Unaware / Resistant / Neutral / Supportive / Leading |
| **Desired engagement level** | Supportive / Leading |
| **Gap / issue** | Concerned about workload on their team |
| **Root cause** | Not involved in planning; surprised by timeline |
| **Strategy** | Meet 1:1; listen to concerns; adjust transition plan; involve in sprint reviews |
| **Next action** | Schedule 30-min meeting this week |
| **Owner** | PM |
| **Follow-up date** | Weekly check-in |

::: tip 💡 Exam shortcut
If a stakeholder becomes resistant during execution, the best first move is usually **active listening** (understand their concern) before trying to "sell" them on the project.
:::

---

## 📨 Communication Methods Comparison (Quick Reference)
Choose the right channel for the situation.

| Method | When to use | Strengths | Weaknesses | Exam context |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Face-to-face** | Conflict, bad news, complex negotiation | Highest richness; builds trust | Time-intensive; not scalable | Best for sensitive issues |
| **Video call** | Distributed teams; urgent alignment | Visual cues; real-time | Timezone challenges; fatigue | Good for virtual teams |
| **Phone call** | Urgent clarification; quick decision | Fast; personal | No visual; no record | Use when email is too slow |
| **Email** | Status updates; formal record | Documented; asynchronous | Misinterpretation risk; delays | Good for audit trail |
| **Chat / IM** | Quick questions; team coordination | Fast; informal | No record; interrupts flow | Use sparingly in execution |
| **Dashboard / portal** | Ongoing metrics; self-service data | Always available; visual | Requires maintenance | Good for transparent progress |

::: info 🔍 PMP nuance
**Interactive communication** (meetings, calls) is best for complex issues. **Push communication** (email, reports) is best for distributing information. **Pull communication** (dashboards, wikis) is best for self-service access.
:::

---

## 🤝 Conflict Resolution Approaches (PMP Reference)
The exam tests which approach fits the situation.

| Approach | Description | When to use | Exam keyword | Sustainability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Collaborate / Problem-solve** | Work together to find a win-win solution that satisfies both parties | High-stakes; long-term relationships; creative options available | "Best approach"; "Permanent solution" | ✅ High (addresses root cause) |
| **Compromise** | Each party gives up something to reach middle ground | Time pressure; equal power; moderate importance | "Split the difference"; "Meet halfway" | ⚠️ Medium (partial satisfaction) |
| **Accommodate / Smooth** | Yield to the other party to preserve harmony | Low importance to you; preserve relationship; you were wrong | "Keep the peace"; "Let it go" | ⚠️ Medium (may build resentment) |
| **Force / Direct** | Impose a solution using authority or power | Emergency; safety risk; low importance to others | "Make a decision"; "Use authority" | ❌ Low (builds resentment) |
| **Withdraw / Avoid** | Postpone or sidestep the conflict | Cooling-off period needed; trivial issue; no chance of winning | "Table the discussion"; "Revisit later" | ❌ Low (conflict may escalate) |

::: tip 💡 Exam shortcut
The exam usually favors **Collaborate** for team conflicts (win-win, addresses root cause). Use **Force** only for emergencies or when you have clear authority and the stakes are high.

## 🏃 Sprint Planning Checklist

Use to ensure effective sprint planning meetings.

### Before Sprint Planning
- [ ] **Product Backlog groomed**: Top items refined, estimated, and prioritized
- [ ] **Velocity known**: Team knows their average capacity from past sprints
- [ ] **Definition of Ready met**: Stories have acceptance criteria, estimates, and are clear
- [ ] **Stakeholder availability**: PO and key stakeholders available for questions
- [ ] **Technical constraints identified**: Dependencies, environments, tools confirmed

### During Sprint Planning
- [ ] **Sprint Goal defined**: One clear objective for the sprint (not just a list of items)
- [ ] **Team selects work**: Team pulls stories (not PM/PO assigning)
- [ ] **Capacity discussed**: Account for vacations, meetings, other commitments
- [ ] **Stories decomposed**: Break items into tasks (max 1 day each)
- [ ] **Dependencies identified**: Note any external dependencies or handoffs
- [ ] **Risks discussed**: What could block us this sprint?
- [ ] **Team commits**: Team agrees they can deliver the selected scope

### After Sprint Planning
- [ ] **Sprint Backlog visible**: All items and tasks on the board
- [ ] **Sprint Goal posted**: Visible to team and stakeholders
- [ ] **First day's work clear**: Everyone knows what to start tomorrow
- [ ] **Retrospective scheduled**: End of sprint meeting on calendar

::: warning ⚠️ Anti-Pattern Alert
If sprint planning takes too long (>4 hours for 2-week sprint) or ends without a clear sprint goal, the team lacks backlog refinement practices. The fix is **better grooming before planning**, not longer planning meetings.
:::

## 🎯 Risk Response Execution Checklist

Use when a risk trigger occurs and you need to execute the planned response.

### Step 1: Confirm Trigger
- [ ] Verify the risk has actually occurred (not just a similar event)
- [ ] Confirm the trigger matches what was defined in the Risk Register
- [ ] Document the actual trigger conditions

### Step 2: Execute Response
- [ ] Retrieve the risk response plan from the Risk Register
- [ ] Execute the planned response immediately (avoid delays)
- [ ] If planned response isn't possible, escalate for alternative decision
- [ ] Document actions taken with timestamps

### Step 3: Convert to Issue
- [ ] Create an Issue Log entry (Issue ID, description, date, owner)
- [ ] Update Risk Register: Mark as "Occurred" or close the risk
- [ ] Link the Issue to the original Risk for traceability

### Step 4: Assess Actual Impact
- [ ] Compare actual impact to planned impact
- [ ] If impact exceeds contingency reserve, prepare change request
- [ ] Identify any secondary risks created by the response

### Step 5: Communicate
- [ ] Notify stakeholders per the Communications Plan
- [ ] Provide: What happened, actions taken, current status, next steps
- [ ] Update status reports and dashboards

### Step 6: Capture Lessons
- [ ] What worked in the response? What didn't?
- [ ] Was the risk correctly assessed? Was the response effective?
- [ ] Update Lessons Learned Register
- [ ] Recommend process improvements if needed

::: tip 💡 Exam Shortcut
If a risk occurs, your FIRST action is **execute the pre-planned response**, not "analyze the situation" or "create a new plan." Risk planning exists precisely for this moment.

- [ ] **Async-first default** (minimize meetings, maximize documentation)

### Communication Cadence
- [ ] **Daily standup scheduled** (video on; consistent time or rotating)
- [ ] **Weekly team sync** (longer agenda; blockers, priorities, demos)
- [ ] **1-on-1s scheduled** (every 1-2 weeks with each team member)
- [ ] **Retrospectives scheduled** (end of each sprint/phase)

### Trust Building Activities
- [ ] **Virtual team-building scheduled** (not just work; social connection)
- [ ] **Personal check-ins incorporated** (brief "how are you?" in meetings)
- [ ] **Recognition rituals established** (kudos channel, celebration of wins)
- [ ] **Informal channels created** (virtual coffee, non-work chat)

### Meeting Effectiveness
- [ ] **Agenda shared in advance** (no surprise topics)
- [ ] **Video default for all meetings** (cameras on when feasible)
- [ ] **Engagement techniques used** (polls, reactions, call on quiet members)
- [ ] **Meetings recorded** (for async viewers in other time zones)
- [ ] **Action items captured** (who, what, when—before ending)

### Onboarding New Virtual Team Members
- [ ] **Welcome video call scheduled** (meet the team)
- [ ] **Documentation shared** (project context, decisions, culture)
- [ ] **Buddy/mentor assigned** (connection for questions)
- [ ] **Tool access verified** (all platforms, repos, boards)
- [ ] **Early 1-on-1 with PM** (check-in after first week)

### Monitoring Engagement
- [ ] **Participation tracked** (who is quieter than usual?)
- [ ] **1-on-1 pulse checks** (ask about blockers, workload, morale)
- [ ] **Action on silence** (reach out to disengaged team members)
- [ ] **Retrospective feedback reviewed** (trends in team health)

::: warning ⚠️ Virtual Team Red Flags
Watch for: Cameras always off, declining response times, reduced meeting participation, isolation patterns. Don't assume "no news is good news"—proactively check in.

## 🎯 Value Delivery Assessment (Fast Checklist)

Use during execution to ensure the project is on track to deliver value (not just outputs).

| Question | Status | Notes / Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Output**: Are we producing the planned deliverables? | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ | |
| **Outcome**: Will users actually adopt the solution? | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ | |
| **Benefit**: Can we measure the expected improvement? | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ | |
| **Leading indicators**: Are usage/training/feedback signals positive? | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ | |
| **Stakeholder validation**: Do users confirm this solves their problem? | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ | |
| **Operational readiness**: Is operations prepared to sustain the solution? | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ | |
| **Benefits owner**: Is someone accountable for post-delivery value? | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ | |

**If you have multiple ⚠️ or ❌**: Stop and re-align with stakeholders. Meeting the schedule means nothing if the value won't materialize.

## 📋 Servant Leadership Checklist (Daily Execution)
Use to stay focused on removing impediments and enabling the team.

**Daily / Standup Focus:**
- [ ] What blockers exist today? (Identify impediments)
- [ ] Who can remove each blocker? (Assign owners)
- [ ] What resources/decisions does the team need? (Provide support)
- [ ] Are priorities still correct? (Adjust if value shifts)
- [ ] Is anyone overloaded or context-switching? (Protect focus)

**Weekly / Checkpoint Focus:**
- [ ] Are there systemic blockers? (Process, tools, access, policies)
- [ ] What feedback have we received? (User demos, retrospectives)
- [ ] What lessons have we learned? (Update lessons learned register)
- [ ] Do stakeholders have what they need? (Proactive communication)
- [ ] Is the team motivated and healthy? (Morale, conflict, workload)

**Sprint / Phase Focus:**
- [ ] Did we deliver value? (Outcomes, not just outputs)
- [ ] What will we improve next? (Retrospective actions)
- [ ] Is operational readiness progressing? (Training, docs, support)
- [ ] Are dependencies with other teams clear? (Coordination)

::: tip 💡 Exam shortcut
Servant leadership means **the team's success is your success**. If they're blocked, your job is to clear the path—not micromanage their work.

## 🧠 Knowledge Management Methods (Quick Reference)
The exam tests how you capture and share knowledge.

| Knowledge Type | Examples | Capture Method | Share Method |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Explicit** (codified) | Code, blueprints, processes, manuals | Documentation, repositories, templates | Wiki, SharePoint, training materials |
| **Tacit** (experience-based) | "Know-how," judgment, intuition | Pair programming, shadowing, retrospectives | Communities of practice, mentoring, demos |

### Knowledge capture during execution
- **Lessons Learned Register**: Update weekly (not just at project end)
- **Decision Log**: Record why you chose option A over B (prevents re-litigation)
- **Retrospectives**: Turn team feedback into actionable improvements
- **Demos / Show-and-tell**: Share tacit knowledge through demonstration
- **After-action reviews**: Quick debrief after incidents or milestones

::: info 🔍 PMP nuance
Tacit knowledge is best transferred through **social interaction** (pairing, collaboration, communities). Don't just write a manual and expect people to learn complex judgment.
:::

## 🧰 Quality Tools Reference (Execution Context)
Use these tools to prevent and detect defects.

| Tool | What it does | When to use | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Definition of Done (DoD)** | Checklist of requirements for "complete" work | Every user story, task, or deliverable | "Unit tests pass, code reviewed, docs updated, no critical bugs" |
| **Peer review / Code review** | Team member inspects work before acceptance | Before merging code or finalizing deliverables | Pull request review, design review |
| **Checklist** | Simple list of steps to ensure consistency | Repetitive tasks (deployments, testing, onboarding) | Pre-flight checklist, release checklist |
| **Root cause analysis (5 Whys, Fishbone)** | Identify underlying cause of defects | After recurring issues or major defects | "Why did the deployment fail? Because tests weren't run. Why? Because..." |
| **Test-driven development (TDD)** | Write tests before code to prevent defects | High-risk or complex logic | Unit tests, acceptance tests |
| **Continuous integration (CI)** | Automated build + test on every commit | Prevent integration defects | Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CircleCI |

::: tip 💡 Exam shortcut
**Prevention** (peer reviews, DoD, checklists) is better than **detection** (testing, inspection). Agile favors built-in quality over end-of-phase inspection.

## 🔀 Decision Tree: Impediment Escalation
Use this decision flow when a blocker surfaces.

```
START: Team member is blocked
    │
    ├─→ Can the TEAM remove it immediately?
    │   ├─ YES → Remove it now → Update impediment log → DONE
    │   └─ NO → Continue
    │
    ├─→ Can the PM remove it (within authority)?
    │   ├─ YES → Take action → Update issue log → Follow up → DONE
    │   └─ NO → Continue
    │
    ├─→ Is it a functional manager / resource issue?
    │   ├─ YES → Escalate to functional manager → Set deadline → Follow up daily → DONE
    │   └─ NO → Continue
    │
    ├─→ Is it a vendor / external dependency?
    │   ├─ YES → Check contract → Escalate per contract terms → Log issue → DONE
    │   └─ NO → Continue
    │
    ├─→ Is it a policy / process / tool issue?
    │   ├─ YES → Escalate to PMO / operations → Request exception or change → DONE
    │   └─ NO → Continue
    │
    └─→ Escalate to SPONSOR (authority needed)
        └─ Present: Problem + Impact + Options + Recommendation → Decision → DONE
```

**Key principle**: Don't wait. Escalate fast, follow up relentlessly.

---

## 🔀 Decision Tree: Change Request Triage (Predictive)
Use when a stakeholder requests a change to scope/schedule/cost.

```
START: Change request received
    │
    ├─→ Is it INSIDE current scope (clarification, not change)?
    │   ├─ YES → Clarify with stakeholder → Execute as planned → Update docs → DONE
    │   └─ NO → Continue (it's a real change)
    │
    ├─→ Does it impact baselines (scope/schedule/cost/quality)?
    │   ├─ NO → Log as minor issue → Execute → Update project docs → DONE
    │   └─ YES → Continue (requires formal analysis)
    │
    ├─→ Perform integrated impact analysis:
    │   ├─ Scope impact (deliverables affected)
    │   ├─ Schedule impact (critical path, milestones)
    │   ├─ Cost impact (labor, materials, vendor)
    │   ├─ Quality impact (testing, acceptance criteria)
    │   ├─ Risk impact (new risks created)
    │   └─ Generate options (approve / defer / reject / modify)
    │
    ├─→ Does PM have approval authority for this impact level?
    │   ├─ YES → Make decision → Update baselines → Communicate → DONE
    │   └─ NO → Continue (needs CCB approval)
    │
    ├─→ Submit to CCB (Change Control Board):
    │   ├─ Present: Request + Impact analysis + Options + Recommendation
    │   ├─ CCB Decision: Approved / Rejected / Deferred
    │   │
    │   ├─ APPROVED → Update baselines → Update change log → Communicate → Execute → DONE
    │   ├─ REJECTED → Update change log → Communicate to requester → DONE
    │   └─ DEFERRED → Log for future consideration → Communicate → DONE
```

**Key principle**: Always analyze impact before deciding. Never "quietly" change baselines.

---

## 🔀 Decision Tree: Value Delivery Risk (Hybrid/Agile)
Use when you sense the project is at risk of delivering outputs without outcomes.

```
START: Concern about value delivery
    │
    ├─→ Are users/stakeholders engaged in validating the work?
    │   ├─ NO → Schedule demo / review → Get feedback → Adjust priorities → Re-engage
    │   └─ YES → Continue
    │
    ├─→ Are we measuring leading indicators (usage, adoption, feedback)?
    │   ├─ NO → Define metrics → Start tracking → Review weekly → Adjust
    │   └─ YES → Continue
    │
    ├─→ Are leading indicators positive?
    │   ├─ NO → Investigate root cause → Re-validate with users → Pivot if needed
    │   └─ YES → Continue
    │
    ├─→ Is operational readiness progressing (training, support, docs)?
    │   ├─ NO → Accelerate transition planning → Assign owners → Track → Escalate gaps
    │   └─ YES → Continue
    │
    ├─→ Is there a benefits owner accountable for post-delivery value?
    │   ├─ NO → Identify owner → Confirm metrics → Schedule benefits reviews → DONE
    │   └─ YES → Continue
    │
    └─→ Is the benefits owner aligned on success criteria?
        ├─ NO → Re-align on outcomes → Adjust acceptance criteria → DONE
        └─ YES → Continue delivering → Monitor value signals → DONE
```

**Key principle**: Value delivery requires continuous validation. Don't wait until go-live to discover users won't adopt.

## EVM During Execution (Monitoring Example)
Use EVM to detect variances early and forecast final outcomes.

### Scenario
You're in Month 4 of a 10-month project. Here's the current status:

- **Budget at Completion (BAC)**: $500,000
- **Planned Value (PV)**: $200,000 (should have spent by now)
- **Actual Cost (AC)**: $220,000 (actually spent)
- **Earned Value (EV)**: $180,000 (value of work completed)

### Calculate Performance

| Metric | Formula | Calculation | Result | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Schedule Variance (SV)** | EV - PV | $180k - $200k | **-$20k** | ⚠️ Behind schedule |
| **Cost Variance (CV)** | EV - AC | $180k - $220k | **-$40k** | ⚠️ Over budget |
| **Schedule Performance Index (SPI)** | EV ÷ PV | $180k ÷ $200k | **0.90** | ⚠️ 90% efficient (slow) |
| **Cost Performance Index (CPI)** | EV ÷ AC | $180k ÷ $220k | **0.82** | ⚠️ 82% efficient (overspending) |

### Forecast Final Outcomes

| Metric | Formula | Calculation | Result | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Estimate at Completion (EAC)** | BAC ÷ CPI | $500k ÷ 0.82 | **$609,756** | Final cost forecast |
| **Estimate to Complete (ETC)** | EAC - AC | $609,756 - $220k | **$389,756** | Cost to finish |
| **Variance at Completion (VAC)** | BAC - EAC | $500k - $609,756 | **-$109,756** | ⚠️ Over budget at end |
| **To-Complete Performance Index (TCPI)** | (BAC - EV) ÷ (BAC - AC) | ($500k - $180k) ÷ ($500k - $220k) | **1.14** | Must be 114% efficient to finish on budget |

### Interpretation & Action
- **Red flag**: CPI = 0.82 means we're overspending significantly
- **Red flag**: TCPI = 1.14 means we need to be **more efficient going forward** than we've been historically (unlikely)
- **Action**: Present to sponsor → Request budget increase OR reduce scope → Update baselines

::: warning ⚠️ Common Exam Trap
If **CPI < 1.0** and **TCPI > 1.0**, the project is unlikely to finish on budget without corrective action (scope reduction, efficiency improvement, or budget increase).

## 📈 Value Metrics Tracking (Leading Indicators)
Use during execution to predict whether value will materialize.

| Metric Type | Example Metrics | What it predicts | Target / Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Adoption signals** | % users trained, % users activated, demo attendance | Will users actually use it? | >80% trained before go-live |
| **Engagement signals** | Active users, feature usage %, session length | Are users finding value? | >50% adoption in first 30 days |
| **Feedback signals** | NPS score, satisfaction surveys, support tickets | Are users satisfied? | NPS >30, satisfaction >4/5 |
| **Quality signals** | Defect density, test pass rate, escaped defects | Will it work reliably? | <5 defects per release |
| **Operational readiness** | Runbook completion, support staffing, SLA readiness | Can operations sustain it? | 100% complete 2 weeks before go-live |
| **Benefit metrics** | Time saved, cost reduced, revenue increased | Are outcomes happening? | Meet baseline targets within 3 months |

**Example**: If only 40% of users are trained 1 week before go-live, **value is at risk**. Action: Delay go-live OR accept partial adoption.

## 🎯 Execution "First Moves" Quick Reference
Use this when an exam question asks "What should you do FIRST?"

| Scenario | Wrong first move | Right first move | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Team member is blocked** | Log it and wait | Remove/escalate blocker immediately | Servant leadership: restore flow |
| **Risk occurred** | Update risk register | Execute risk response → log as issue | It's not a risk anymore; it's an issue |
| **Stakeholder wants change** | Say "yes" or "no" | Assess impact → follow change process | Never change baselines informally |
| **Defect found in production** | Blame someone | Fix → root cause analysis → prevent recurrence | Focus on the system, not the person |
| **Users unhappy despite meeting requirements** | Defend the requirements | Re-engage users → validate outcomes | Requirements are a means, not the end |
| **Vendor underperforming** | Threaten them | Check contract → escalate per terms → ADR if needed | Contract is the rulebook |
| **Team conflict** | Ignore it or force a solution | Facilitate collaboration (win-win) | Collaborate addresses root cause |
| **Operations won't accept handoff** | Force go-live anyway | Close readiness gaps (training, docs, support) | Value collapses without adoption |
| **Schedule slipping** | Work overtime | Analyze root cause → adjust plan OR scope | Sustainable pace; fix the system |
| **Stakeholder disengaged** | Send more emails | Meet 1:1 → listen → re-engage | Active listening builds support |

## 📐 EVM Formula Quick Reference (Execution Context)

### Core Metrics
| Formula | What it tells you | Good = | Bad = |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SV = EV - PV** | Schedule variance (dollars behind/ahead) | Positive | Negative |
| **CV = EV - AC** | Cost variance (dollars under/over budget) | Positive | Negative |
| **SPI = EV ÷ PV** | Schedule efficiency (pace) | > 1.0 | < 1.0 |
| **CPI = EV ÷ AC** | Cost efficiency (spending) | > 1.0 | < 1.0 |

### Forecasting
| Formula | What it tells you | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **EAC = BAC ÷ CPI** | Forecast final cost (assumes current efficiency continues) | Most common exam formula |
| **EAC = AC + BAC - EV** | Forecast final cost (assumes remaining work on plan) | When current variances are atypical |
| **EAC = AC + [(BAC - EV) ÷ (CPI × SPI)]** | Forecast final cost (considers both cost and schedule) | When both cost and schedule matter |
| **ETC = EAC - AC** | Cost to complete remaining work | Planning remaining budget |
| **VAC = BAC - EAC** | Variance at completion (over/under budget at end) | Reporting to sponsor |
| **TCPI = (BAC - EV) ÷ (BAC - AC)** | Efficiency needed to finish on budget | Determining if budget target is realistic |
| **TCPI = (BAC - EV) ÷ (EAC - AC)** | Efficiency needed to finish at EAC | When you've accepted a new budget (EAC) |

### Interpretation Cheat Sheet
| Condition | Interpretation | Likely action |
|---|---|---|
| **CPI < 1.0** | Overspending | Request budget increase OR reduce scope |
| **SPI < 1.0** | Behind schedule | Fast-track OR crash OR reduce scope |
| **TCPI > 1.0** | Need higher efficiency than historical | Unlikely to meet budget without change |
| **CPI > 1.0 AND SPI > 1.0** | Ahead of plan (rare!) | Continue; watch for scope creep |
| **VAC < 0** | Will finish over budget | Escalate to sponsor; request change |

## 🗣️ Communication Model Quick Reference

### Communication Formula
**Channels = n(n-1) ÷ 2**
- Where n = number of stakeholders
- Example: 10 stakeholders = 10(9) ÷ 2 = **45 communication channels**

### Communication Methods (Push / Pull / Interactive)
| Method | Type | Example | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Email, memo, report** | Push | Status report | Documented updates; audit trail |
| **Wiki, portal, dashboard** | Pull | SharePoint, Jira | Self-service; always-available data |
| **Meeting, call, video** | Interactive | Daily standup, demo | Complex issues; real-time feedback |

### Effective Listening
- **Active listening**: Focus, summarize, confirm understanding, ask questions
- **Empathetic listening**: Understand emotions and concerns (not just words)
- **Remove barriers**: Noise, distractions, language, jargon, assumptions

## 🛠️ Team Performance & Development Quick Reference

### Tuckman's Team Development Stages
| Stage | Behavior | PM Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Forming** | Polite, uncertain, feeling each other out | Set clear goals; establish working agreements |
| **Storming** | Conflict, competing ideas, resistance | Facilitate collaboration; address conflict directly |
| **Norming** | Cooperation, shared norms, trust building | Encourage; reinforce positive behaviors |
| **Performing** | High trust, self-organizing, productive | Delegate; remove impediments; celebrate wins |
| **Adjourning** | Closure, transition, saying goodbye | Celebrate achievements; capture lessons learned |

### Motivation Theories (Exam Context)
| Theory | Core idea | Application |
|---|---|---|
| **Maslow's Hierarchy** | People have levels of needs (physiological → safety → social → esteem → self-actualization) | Ensure basic needs are met before expecting high performance |
| **Herzberg's Two-Factor** | Hygiene factors (salary, safety) prevent dissatisfaction; motivators (achievement, recognition) drive satisfaction | Fix hygiene issues; add motivators for engagement |
| **McGregor's Theory X/Y** | Theory X: People avoid work (need control). Theory Y: People seek responsibility (need autonomy) | Use Theory Y approach (trust, empowerment) for knowledge work |
| **Vroom's Expectancy** | Motivation = Expectancy × Instrumentality × Valence | Clarify that effort → performance → valuable reward |

## ⚖️ Power & Influence Quick Reference

### Types of Power
| Type | Source | Example | Sustainability |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Formal / Legitimate** | Position, title | "I'm the PM" | Medium (only within authority) |
| **Reward** | Ability to give benefits | Bonuses, recognition | Medium (limited by budget) |
| **Penalty / Coercive** | Ability to punish | "Do this or else" | Low (builds resentment) |
| **Expert** | Knowledge, skills | "I know how to solve this" | High (builds respect) |
| **Referent** | Charisma, respect | "People want to work with me" | High (builds loyalty) |

**Best practice**: Rely on **Expert** and **Referent** power (influence) over **Penalty** power (coercion).

## 🧩 ADKAR Change Model (Adoption Quick Reference)
Use to diagnose why adoption is failing.

| Stage | Question | If NO, then... |
|---|---|---|
| **Awareness** | Do people know WHY the change is needed? | Increase communication; explain business case |
| **Desire** | Do they WANT to support the change? | Address concerns; emphasize WIIFM (What's In It For Me) |
| **Knowledge** | Do they know HOW to change? | Provide training, documentation, demos |
| **Ability** | Can they actually DO it? | Provide practice, coaching, support, tools |
| **Reinforcement** | Will they SUSTAIN the change? | Celebrate wins, provide feedback, adjust incentives |

**Exam pattern**: If operations resists handoff, strengthen **Knowledge** (training) and **Ability** (support, tools).

## 🎓 Exam-Day Execution Mindset Summary

### The "Servant Leader" Lens
- **Impediment?** → Remove it or escalate immediately
- **Conflict?** → Facilitate collaboration (win-win)
- **Quality issue?** → Fix the system, not the person
- **Stakeholder unhappy?** → Listen first, then act
- **Value at risk?** → Re-engage users; validate outcomes

### The "Value First" Lens
- **Meeting requirements ≠ delivering value**
- **Outputs → Outcomes → Benefits → Value**
- **Measure leading indicators** (adoption, engagement, feedback)
- **Operational readiness is mandatory** (not optional)
- **Benefits owner is accountable** (not the PM after handoff)

### The "Governance" Lens
- **Change baselines?** → Follow formal change control
- **Vendor issue?** → Check contract first
- **Stakeholder issue?** → Check stakeholder engagement plan first
- **Communication issue?** → Check communications management plan first
- **Never "wing it"** → Use the plan, then update the plan
