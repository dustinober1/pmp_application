# 8.4 Engagement & Procurements

**ECO Task**: Plan and manage procurement

Execution is not just about the team; it's about navigating the web of **Stakeholders**, **Communications**, and **Vendors**. This section covers the "people and contracts" side of execution.

::: info 📋 PMP Exam Context
This chapter maps to **Process Group: Executing** in the PMBOK Guide. Team engagement and procurement execution are critical for PMP success, covering:
- Team development models (Tuckman, Drexler-Sibbet)
- Motivation theories (Maslow, Herzberg, McGregor Theory X/Y)
- Conflict resolution techniques (collaborating, compromising, smoothing, forcing, withdrawal)
- Procurement execution (seller selection, contract negotiation, claims management)

## 👥 Develop Team & Build High Performance

Before managing stakeholders externally, you must build a cohesive, high-performing **internal team**. This is covered in the **Develop Team** process.

### Tuckman's Team Development Model

Teams typically progress through five stages. Understanding where your team is helps you apply the right interventions.

| Stage | Description | Team Behavior | PM Actions |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Forming** | Team comes together; polite, uncertain | Low productivity; testing boundaries | Set clear goals; establish ground rules; facilitate introductions |
| **Storming** | Conflicts emerge; power struggles | Disagreements over approach; frustration | Address conflicts directly; coach through differences; clarify roles |
| **Norming** | Team finds rhythm; agreements form | Collaboration improves; trust builds | Reinforce positive behaviors; delegate more; recognize progress |
| **Performing** | Team operates at high efficiency | Self-organizing; high productivity | Empower the team; remove obstacles; focus on strategic issues |
| **Adjourning** | Project ends; team disbands | Reflection; possible grief or relief | Celebrate success; conduct lessons learned; help transition members |

::: tip 💡 Exam Insight
Teams can **regress** to earlier stages when membership changes, new conflicts arise, or major scope changes occur. If a high-performing team suddenly has infighting after a new member joins, they may have slipped back to **Storming**.
:::

### Drexler-Sibbet Team Performance Model

An alternative model focusing on **questions** the team must answer:

1. **Orientation**: Why am I here? (Purpose clarity)
2. **Trust Building**: Who are you? (Relationships)
3. **Goal Clarification**: What are we doing? (Shared vision)
4. **Commitment**: How will we do it? (Approach agreement)
5. **Implementation**: Who does what, when, where? (Execution)
6. **High Performance**: Wow! (Synergy and flow)
7. **Renewal**: Why continue? (Sustaining momentum)

### Team-Building Activities

- **Co-location**: Physical proximity improves communication (war rooms, team spaces).
- **Training**: Skill development that also builds camaraderie.
- **Team-Building Events**: Offsite workshops, social activities, trust exercises.
- **Recognition & Rewards**: Publicly acknowledging contributions.
- **Ground Rules**: Team-created norms (e.g., "no laptops in meetings," "respond to emails within 24 hours").

::: warning ⚠️ Common Pitfall
**Individual rewards** in a team environment can **undermine collaboration**. If one developer gets a bonus for closing the most tickets, others may hoard knowledge or avoid helping. Prefer **team-based rewards** that incentivize collective success.
:::

## 🎯 Motivation Theories

Understanding what drives people helps you create an environment where team members are intrinsically motivated.

### Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

People are motivated by unfulfilled needs, progressing from basic to higher-level needs:

```
        Self-Actualization
       (Creativity, problem-solving, reaching potential)
              ↑
           Esteem
       (Recognition, achievement, respect)
              ↑
          Social
      (Belonging, teamwork, relationships)
              ↑
          Safety
     (Job security, safe working conditions)
              ↑
       Physiological
    (Salary, breaks, comfortable workspace)
```

**PM Application**: If a team member is worried about job security (Safety need), offering them a "challenging stretch assignment" (Self-Actualization) won't motivate them. Address the lower-level need first.

**Example Scenario**:
- **Situation**: Developer seems unmotivated despite interesting work.
- **Diagnosis**: Recent company layoffs have created fear (Safety need unmet).
- **Action**: Provide reassurance about project stability; ensure transparent communication about team status.

### Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory (Motivation-Hygiene)

Herzberg distinguished between **Hygiene Factors** (which prevent dissatisfaction) and **Motivators** (which create satisfaction).

| Hygiene Factors (Prevent Dissatisfaction) | Motivators (Create Satisfaction) |
|---|---|
| Salary, benefits | Achievement |
| Working conditions | Recognition |
| Company policies | Responsibility |
| Job security | Growth opportunities |
| Supervisor quality | Advancement |

**Key Insight**: Improving hygiene factors (e.g., better coffee, nicer desks) only prevents dissatisfaction—it doesn't create motivation. To truly motivate, focus on **Motivators** (meaningful work, recognition, autonomy).

**Example Scenario**:
- **Situation**: Team complains about outdated laptops (Hygiene factor).
- **Action**: Fix the laptops to remove dissatisfaction, but **also** provide challenging work and recognition (Motivators) to boost engagement.

### McGregor's Theory X and Theory Y

Two contrasting management philosophies:

| Theory X (Traditional View) | Theory Y (Modern View) |
|---|---|
| People inherently dislike work | People view work as natural as play |
| Must be coerced, controlled, threatened | People are self-directed and seek responsibility |
| Prefer to be directed; avoid responsibility | People are creative and innovative |
| **Management Style**: Autocratic, micromanagement | **Management Style**: Empowering, participative |

**PM Application**: Most knowledge workers respond better to **Theory Y** leadership. Agile methodologies embody Theory Y by trusting teams to self-organize.

**Example**:
- **Theory X PM**: "I need daily status reports and approval for every technical decision."
- **Theory Y PM**: "Here are the goals and constraints. How do you think we should approach this?"

### Expectancy Theory (Vroom)

Motivation = **Expectancy** × **Instrumentality** × **Valence**

- **Expectancy**: "If I work hard, will I succeed?" (Effort → Performance)
- **Instrumentality**: "If I succeed, will I get a reward?" (Performance → Outcome)
- **Valence**: "Do I value the reward?" (Value of Outcome)

**Example**:
- If you tell a junior developer, "Complete this feature and you'll get a promotion," but they don't believe they can build it (**low expectancy**), they won't be motivated—even if they value the promotion.

### Achievement Theory (McClelland)

People are driven by three needs:
- **Need for Achievement (nAch)**: Desire to excel, solve problems, accomplish challenging goals.
- **Need for Affiliation (nAff)**: Desire for friendly relationships and acceptance.
- **Need for Power (nPow)**: Desire to influence, lead, and control.

**PM Application**: Assign tasks aligned with individuals' dominant needs:
- **High nAch**: Give challenging technical problems with clear success metrics.
- **High nAff**: Assign to collaborative tasks; involve in team-building.
- **High nPow**: Offer leadership roles, mentoring opportunities.

---

## ⚔️ Conflict Resolution Techniques

Conflict is **inevitable** in projects. The key is to address it constructively. PMI recognizes five conflict resolution techniques, ranked roughly from most to least effective:

### 1. Collaborating / Problem-Solving (Best)
**Approach**: Work together to find a solution that fully satisfies all parties. Win-win.

**When to Use**: High-stakes issues where both parties' needs are important and time permits.

**Example**:
- **Conflict**: Engineering wants to use Technology A (faster development). QA wants Technology B (easier testing).
- **Collaborative Solution**: Research a hybrid approach or Technology C that offers both speed and testability. Schedule a joint workshop to evaluate options.

**Outcome**: Both parties feel heard; solution is often innovative.

### 2. Compromising
**Approach**: Each party gives up something to reach a middle ground. Lose-lose, but acceptable.

**When to Use**: When a quick resolution is needed and perfect satisfaction isn't possible.

**Example**:
- **Conflict**: Marketing wants feature X in Release 1. Development says it will delay the release by 2 months.
- **Compromise**: Deliver a simplified version of feature X in Release 1, with full functionality in Release 2.

**Outcome**: Neither party gets everything, but both get something.

### 3. Smoothing / Accommodating
**Approach**: Emphasize areas of agreement; downplay differences. Temporarily "keep the peace."

**When to Use**: When the issue is minor or when preserving relationships is more important than the specific outcome.

**Example**:
- **Conflict**: Two developers disagree on code style (tabs vs. spaces).
- **Smoothing**: "Both approaches work. Let's follow the existing project standard and move forward."

**Outcome**: Conflict is de-escalated, but underlying issue may resurface.

::: warning ⚠️ Caution
Smoothing can **suppress legitimate concerns**. If used repeatedly on significant issues, resentment builds.
:::

### 4. Forcing / Directing
**Approach**: Impose a decision. Win-lose. One party gets their way; the other does not.

**When to Use**: Emergencies, ethical issues, or when you have clear authority and time is critical.

**Example**:
- **Conflict**: Team wants to skip security testing to meet a deadline.
- **Forcing**: "We will not skip security testing. That's non-negotiable. We'll adjust the scope or timeline instead."

**Outcome**: Fast resolution, but the losing party may feel resentful.

### 5. Withdrawing / Avoiding (Least Effective)
**Approach**: Postpone or ignore the conflict. Hope it resolves itself.

**When to Use**: When the issue is trivial, when emotions are too high and a cooling-off period is needed, or when you need time to gather information.

**Example**:
- **Conflict**: Two team members have a heated argument in a meeting.
- **Withdrawal**: "Let's table this discussion and revisit it tomorrow when we've had time to think."

**Outcome**: Buys time, but conflict remains unresolved. Can escalate if avoided too long.

### Conflict Resolution Scenario

**Situation**: Your development team (5 people) is split on whether to refactor the codebase now (2 developers) or wait until after the release (3 developers). The release is in 3 weeks.

**Analysis**:
- **Stakes**: High (affects code quality and schedule).
- **Time**: Limited (3 weeks to release).
- **Parties**: Both have valid technical concerns.

**Recommended Approach**: **Collaborating** → Schedule a 2-hour technical session to:
1. Define what "refactor now" means (scope, time required).
2. Assess risk of delaying refactor (technical debt cost).
3. Explore a compromise: Refactor only the most critical modules now; defer the rest.

**Outcome**: Team agrees to refactor the authentication module (highest risk) immediately and schedule the rest for a post-release sprint.

### Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (TKI)

The **TKI Model** maps conflict styles along two axes: **Assertiveness** (satisfying your own concerns) and **Cooperativeness** (satisfying others' concerns).

```
                    HIGH ASSERTIVENESS
                          ↑
           ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
           │              │              │
           │   COMPETING  │ COLLABORATING│
           │   (Forcing)  │  (Win-Win)   │
           │              │              │
LOW ←──────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────→ HIGH
COOPERAT-  │              │              │    COOPERAT-
IVENESS    │  AVOIDING    │ ACCOMMODATING│    IVENESS
           │ (Withdrawal) │  (Smoothing) │
           │              │              │
           └──────────────┼──────────────┘
                    ↓ COMPROMISING ↓
                    (in the middle)
                    
                   LOW ASSERTIVENESS
```

| Mode | Assertiveness | Cooperativeness | When Appropriate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Competing** | High | Low | Emergencies, ethical issues, when you're right and stakes are high |
| **Collaborating** | High | High | Complex problems, important relationships, time available for exploration |
| **Compromising** | Medium | Medium | Time pressure, equal power, moderate importance, interim solutions |
| **Avoiding** | Low | Low | Trivial issues, cooling off, no chance of winning, gathering information |
| **Accommodating** | Low | High | You're wrong, relationship matters more, building goodwill |

::: tip 💡 Exam Application
The exam often presents conflict scenarios and asks which approach to use. Map the scenario to the TKI axes:
- **High stakes + creative solution needed** → Collaborating
- **Emergency + clear authority** → Competing
- **Minor issue + preserve relationship** → Accommodating
- **Need time to calm emotions** → Avoiding
- **Both parties must give up something** → Compromise

## 📜 Contract Types Deep Dive (Execution Context)

During procurement execution, understanding contract types helps you manage vendor relationships and assess risk allocation.

### Contract Type Comparison

| Contract Type | Risk Allocation | When to Use | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Fixed Price (FP)** | Seller bears cost risk | Clear scope, low uncertainty | Building construction per blueprints |
| **Cost Reimbursable (CR)** | Buyer bears cost risk | Unclear scope, high uncertainty | R&D, prototype development |
| **Time & Materials (T&M)** | Shared risk | Unknown duration, known skill needs | Staff augmentation, maintenance |

### Fixed-Price Incentive Fee (FPIF) Calculations

**FPIF** shares cost savings/overruns between buyer and seller within a range.

**Components:**
- **Target Cost**: Expected cost to complete work
- **Target Fee**: Profit margin if target cost is met
- **Target Price**: Target Cost + Target Fee
- **Share Ratio**: How savings/overruns are split (e.g., 80/20)
- **Ceiling Price**: Maximum buyer pays (Price Ceiling)
- **Point of Total Assumption (PTA)**: Where seller assumes all additional cost

**PTA Formula:**
```
PTA = ((Ceiling Price - Target Price) / Buyer's Share Ratio) + Target Cost
```

**Example:**
```
Target Cost: $100,000
Target Fee: $10,000
Target Price: $110,000
Ceiling Price: $130,000
Share Ratio: 80/20 (Buyer 80%, Seller 20%)

PTA = (($130,000 - $110,000) / 0.80) + $100,000
PTA = ($20,000 / 0.80) + $100,000
PTA = $25,000 + $100,000 = $125,000

Interpretation: If actual costs exceed $125,000, the seller absorbs 
100% of additional costs up to the ceiling price.
```

### Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) Calculations

**CPIF** reimburses costs plus a fee that varies based on cost performance.

**Example:**
```
Target Cost: $100,000
Target Fee: $10,000
Share Ratio: 70/30 (Buyer 70%, Seller 30%)
Minimum Fee: $5,000
Maximum Fee: $15,000

Scenario A: Actual Cost = $90,000 (under target)
- Cost Savings: $10,000
- Seller's Share: 30% × $10,000 = $3,000 bonus
- Final Fee: $10,000 + $3,000 = $13,000
- Total Price: $90,000 + $13,000 = $103,000

Scenario B: Actual Cost = $120,000 (over target)
- Cost Overrun: $20,000
- Seller's Share: 30% × $20,000 = $6,000 penalty
- Final Fee: $10,000 - $6,000 = $4,000 (but min fee applies)
- Adjusted Fee: $5,000 (minimum)
- Total Price: $120,000 + $5,000 = $125,000
```

### Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF)

**CPAF** includes a fee determined by subjective evaluation of seller performance.

**Structure:**
- **Base Fee**: Fixed amount paid regardless of performance
- **Award Fee Pool**: Available for excellent performance
- **Award Fee**: Determined by Award Fee Board based on criteria

**Example:**
```
Target Cost: $200,000
Base Fee (fixed): $10,000 (5%)
Award Fee Pool: $20,000 (available for excellence)
Actual Cost: $195,000

Award Board Evaluation:
- Technical Performance: Excellent (4/5)
- Schedule Performance: Good (3/5)
- Communication: Excellent (4/5)
- Overall: 85% award fee earned

Final Fee: $10,000 (base) + (0.85 × $20,000) = $27,000
Total Price: $195,000 + $27,000 = $222,000
```

::: warning ⚠️ Exam Tip
CPAF award fees are **subjective** and **not subject to dispute**. The Award Fee Board's decision is final. This differs from CPIF, where incentive calculations are objective and auditable.

## 🧑‍💼 Servant Leadership in Execution

Servant leadership is critical during execution—the PM's job is to **clear the path** so the team can deliver value. This means prioritizing team needs, removing impediments, and coaching rather than commanding.

### Core Servant Leadership Behaviors

| Behavior | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Removing impediments** | Clear blockers so work can flow | PM contacts IT to expedite server access for blocked developer |
| **Shielding the team** | Protect from distractions and unnecessary demands | PM filters stakeholder requests through proper channels; says "let me handle that" |
| **Facilitating decisions** | Help team reach consensus; don't impose solutions | PM facilitates design discussion; lets team decide approach |
| **Coaching and developing** | Invest in team skills and growth | PM arranges training; pairs junior with senior developers |
| **Active listening** | Understand needs before acting | PM asks "What do you need?" before offering solutions |
| **Building trust** | Be transparent, reliable, and supportive | PM admits mistakes openly; follows through on commitments |

### Servant Leadership vs. Traditional Management

| Aspect | Servant Leadership | Traditional Management |
|---|---|---|
| **Focus** | Team's success | Project's success (may overlook team needs) |
| **Decision-making** | Facilitate team decisions | Manager decides, team executes |
| **Problem-solving** | "How can I help you solve this?" | "Here's what you should do" |
| **Impediments** | PM removes immediately | Team escalates; waits for manager |
| **Information** | Transparent and shared | Filtered and controlled |
| **Development** | Investing in people is priority | Getting work done is priority |

### Practical Servant Leadership Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Team Member Blocked for 2 Days**
- **Situation**: Developer blocked waiting for database access from IT.
- **Traditional Approach**: Log the issue, wait for next status meeting to escalate.
- **Servant Leader Approach**: 
  1. Immediately contact IT lead: "Our developer has been blocked for 2 days. Can we resolve this today?"
  2. Escalate if no response within 4 hours
  3. While waiting, help developer find workaround (mock database, other tasks)
  4. Once resolved, log lesson learned

**Scenario 2: Stakeholder Making Unreasonable Demands**
- **Situation**: Stakeholder emails the team directly demanding scope additions without PM knowledge.
- **Traditional Approach**: Team addresses the stakeholder; PM finds out later.
- **Servant Leader Approach**:
  1. Shield the team by redirecting communication through proper channels
  2. "Thanks for your request. Let me assess the impact and get back to you."
  3. Protect team focus; handle stakeholder relationship directly
  4. If request is valid, follow change control; if not, manage stakeholder expectation

**Scenario 3: Team Conflict Over Technical Approach**
- **Situation**: Two developers disagree strongly on architecture; work is stalled.
- **Traditional Approach**: PM makes the decision and assigns the approach.
- **Servant Leader Approach**:
  1. Facilitate a discussion: "Let's hear both perspectives and understand the trade-offs."
  2. Ask questions: "What are the pros/cons? What risks does each approach carry?"
  3. Let team reach consensus if possible
  4. Only decide if team cannot agree and decision is time-critical

**Scenario 4: Team Member Underperforming**
- **Situation**: One developer consistently delivers late with quality issues.
- **Traditional Approach**: Document issues, reprimand, potentially escalate for removal.
- **Servant Leader Approach**:
  1. Meet privately, listen first: "I've noticed some challenges. What's going on?"
  2. Understand root cause (personal issues? skill gap? unclear expectations?)
  3. Offer support: training, reduced workload, pair programming
  4. Set clear expectations and timeline
  5. Coach and check in frequently
  6. If no improvement after support, then escalate (documented pattern)

::: tip 💡 Exam Insight
If a scenario describes a blocked or struggling team member, look for answers that involve **active problem-solving and support** rather than logging and waiting. Servant leadership means the PM acts immediately to help the team.

## 🤝 Manage Stakeholder Engagement

This is the process of communicating and working with stakeholders to meet their needs, address issues, and foster appropriate involvement.

::: tip 💡 Planning vs. Execution
- **Plan Stakeholder Engagement**: "How *should* we interact with them?" (Strategy)
- **Manage Stakeholder Engagement**: "The actual conversation, email, or meeting." (Action)
:::

### Core Engagement Skills
- **Active Listening**: Hearing what isn't said (concerns about power, status, or job security).
- **Conflict Management**: Addressing resistance early before it hardens.
- **Political Awareness**: Understanding who influences whom.
- **Observation**: Noticing when a stakeholder disengages or becomes hostile.

### The "Engagement Level" Shift
Your goal is to move stakeholders from their current state to the desired state (defined in the plan).

| State | Description | Typical Execution Move |
|---|---|---|
| **Unaware** | Doesn't know about project | Send info; schedule briefing |
| **Resistant** | Aware and resistant to change | Listen to concerns; emphasize WIIFM (What's In It For Me) |
| **Neutral** | Aware but neither supports nor opposes | Engage to build support; prevent slip to resistant |
| **Supportive** | Aware and supportive | Keep informed; ask for small helps |
| **Leading** | Actively engaged in ensuring success | Leverage as a champion to influence others |

---

## 📢 Manage Communications
This is the execution of the Communications Management Plan—creating, collecting, distributing, storing, and retrieving information.

### The "4 Rs" of Execution Communication
1.  **Right Information**: Don't spam; summarize relevant data.
2.  **Right Time**: Before they hear rumors; on the planned cadence.
3.  **Right Audience**: Tailored to their interest and power.
4.  **Right Channel**: Email for record, call for urgency, face-to-face for conflict.

### Communication vs. Engagement
- **Communication**: Sending the status report.
- **Engagement**: Calling them to discuss the red flag in the status report.

::: warning ⚠️ Common Pitfall
Sending an email does not mean you have communicated. Communication only happens when the message is **received and understood**. Use feedback loops (ask questions) to verify understanding.
:::

---

## 🛒 Conduct Procurements (Executing Contracts)

This process involves obtaining seller responses, selecting a seller, and awarding a contract. **Conduct Procurements** is in the **Executing** process group—this is where you move from planning what to buy to actually selecting and contracting with sellers.

### The Procurement Execution Flow

```
Plan Procurement → Request Seller Responses → Evaluate Proposals →
Select Seller → Negotiate Contract → Award Contract → Control Procurements
```

---

### 1. Advertising & Bidder Conferences

**Advertising**: Making the procurement opportunity known to potential sellers.
- **Public Sector**: Often legally required (government contracts must be transparent).
- **Private Sector**: Optional, but broadens the pool of qualified vendors.
- **Channels**: Industry publications, procurement websites, trade associations, vendor databases.

**Bidder Conferences (Pre-Bid Meetings)**:
A meeting with **all** prospective sellers to:
- Clarify the Statement of Work (SOW).
- Answer questions about requirements.
- Ensure all vendors have the same information (level playing field).

::: warning ⚠️ Critical Rule
If **one vendor** asks a question during or after the conference, the answer must be shared with **all vendors**. Giving one vendor private information creates an unfair advantage and may violate procurement ethics or laws.
:::

**Example**:
- **Scenario**: You're procuring cloud infrastructure. Vendor A emails asking, "Can we propose a hybrid cloud solution instead of pure public cloud?"
- **Correct Response**: "Great question. We'll share this with all bidders. Yes, hybrid solutions are acceptable if they meet the performance requirements in Section 3.2 of the SOW."
- **Incorrect Response**: Answering only Vendor A privately.

---

### 2. Proposal Evaluation

You evaluate seller proposals using **Source Selection Criteria** (defined during **Plan Procurement Management**). Common criteria include:

| Criterion | Description | Example Weight |
|---|---|---|
| **Technical Capability** | Can they deliver the solution? | 40% |
| **Price** | Total cost of ownership | 30% |
| **Past Performance** | Track record on similar projects | 15% |
| **Management Approach** | Quality of their project plan | 10% |
| **Financial Stability** | Can they sustain the contract? | 5% |

#### Evaluation Systems

**Screening System (Go/No-Go)**:
Eliminates vendors who don't meet mandatory minimums.

**Example**:
- **Mandatory**: "Must have ISO 27001 certification."
- **Vendor A**: Has certification → Passes screening.
- **Vendor B**: Does not have certification → Eliminated (even if price is lower).

**Weighting System**:
Assigns points based on how well each proposal meets criteria.

**Example**:
| Vendor | Technical (40%) | Price (30%) | Past Performance (15%) | Management (10%) | Financial (5%) | **Total** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Vendor A | 36/40 | 25/30 | 12/15 | 9/10 | 5/5 | **87/100** |
| Vendor B | 38/40 | 20/30 | 15/15 | 8/10 | 4/5 | **85/100** |
| Vendor C | 32/40 | 30/30 | 10/15 | 7/10 | 5/5 | **84/100** |

**Result**: Vendor A wins (highest total score), even though Vendor C had the lowest price. The weighting system allowed technical capability to outweigh cost.

**Independent Estimates**:
Before evaluating, the buyer often creates an **independent cost estimate** to:
- Validate that seller prices are reasonable.
- Identify proposals that are too low (may indicate the seller doesn't understand the scope) or too high (potential overpricing).

---

### 3. Negotiations

Negotiation is a **collaborative process** to reach a fair agreement. The goal is **win-win**, not to exploit the vendor.

**Key Principle**: A bad deal for the seller often leads to poor performance, shortcuts, or even contract abandonment. Fair pricing ensures vendor commitment.

#### Items Typically Negotiated

| Item | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | Deliverables, acceptance criteria | "We'll add the mobile app module if you reduce the web dashboard features." |
| **Price** | Total cost, payment terms | "Can you reduce the price by 10% if we agree to a 12-month contract instead of 6?" |
| **Schedule** | Delivery dates, milestones | "We need delivery by March 1. Can you commit to that if we provide requirements by Jan 15?" |
| **Responsibilities** | Who does what (buyer vs. seller) | "Buyer provides test environment; seller provides test data." |
| **Risk Allocation** | Who bears which risks | "Seller accepts cost overrun risk; buyer accepts schedule risk for late requirement approvals." |
| **Intellectual Property** | Ownership of deliverables, licenses | "Buyer owns the code; seller retains rights to reusable frameworks." |
| **Warranties & SLAs** | Service level agreements, performance guarantees | "Seller guarantees 99.9% uptime; penalties apply if not met." |
| **Change Control** | How changes will be handled | "Changes require written approval and price adjustment within 5 days." |
| **Termination** | Exit clauses, notice periods | "Either party can terminate with 30 days' notice; buyer pays for work completed." |

#### The Project Manager's Role in Negotiations

- **You may not lead negotiations**: Procurement specialists or legal teams often lead.
- **You provide technical expertise**: Clarify scope, validate feasibility, assess risk.
- **You ensure alignment**: Make sure the contract supports the project's objectives.

**Example Scenario**:
- **Situation**: Legal is negotiating a software development contract. The vendor proposes a clause: "Acceptance occurs 5 days after delivery unless buyer objects."
- **PM Input**: "That's too short. Our QA cycle requires 10 days for full regression testing. Acceptance should occur 15 days after delivery or upon successful QA sign-off, whichever is later."

---

### 4. Agreements (Contracts)

The contract is the **legal foundation** of the relationship. It defines:
- **What** will be delivered (scope, deliverables).
- **When** it will be delivered (schedule, milestones).
- **How much** it will cost (price, payment terms).
- **What happens if** things go wrong (remedies, dispute resolution).

**Types of Agreements**:
- **Fixed-Price (FP)**: Seller delivers for a set price. Buyer's risk is low; seller bears cost overrun risk.
- **Cost-Reimbursable (CR)**: Buyer reimburses seller's costs plus a fee. Buyer's risk is higher; seller has less cost risk.
- **Time & Materials (T&M)**: Buyer pays for time and materials used. Risk is shared; often used when scope is uncertain.

*(See Chapter 12: Procurement Planning for detailed contract type analysis.)*

**Key Contract Components**:
- **Statement of Work (SOW)**: Detailed description of deliverables.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: How the buyer will verify that deliverables meet requirements.
- **Payment Terms**: When and how payment occurs (e.g., milestone-based, monthly, upon acceptance).
- **Change Control**: Process for modifying the contract.
- **Dispute Resolution**: ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution), mediation, arbitration, or litigation.
- **Termination Clause**: Conditions under which either party can exit.

On the PMP exam, if there's a dispute, **always check the contract first**. The contract is the authoritative document. "I thought we agreed to X" or "The vendor verbally promised Y" doesn't matter if it's not in the contract.

## 🔧 Managing Vendors During Execution (Control Procurements)

Once the contract is signed, you enter **Control Procurements** (Monitoring & Controlling process group), but daily vendor management feels like execution. This section covers **how to work with sellers** during the project.

### Seller Performance Monitoring

You must actively monitor whether the seller is meeting contract obligations.

**Key Metrics**:
- **Deliverable Quality**: Are deliverables meeting acceptance criteria?
- **Schedule Adherence**: Are milestones being met?
- **Cost Performance**: Are costs within the agreed price (for cost-reimbursable contracts)?
- **Communication**: Is the seller responsive and transparent?

**Tools**:
- **Performance Reviews**: Regular meetings to review progress (weekly, bi-weekly).
- **Inspections & Audits**: Physical verification of work (e.g., inspecting construction progress, code reviews).
- **Earned Value Management (EVM)**: For cost-reimbursable contracts, track seller's CPI and SPI.

**Example**:
- **Contract**: Vendor to deliver 10 software modules over 5 months (2 modules/month).
- **Month 3 Status**: Only 4 modules delivered (should be 6). Two modules failed acceptance testing.
- **Action**: Conduct a performance review. Identify root cause (resource shortage? unclear requirements?). Issue a corrective action request. Document the delay in the procurement file.

---

### Inspections & Quality Verification

**Inspections** are structured reviews to verify that deliverables conform to requirements.

**Types of Inspections**:
- **In-Process Inspections**: Conducted during work (e.g., reviewing code as it's written, inspecting construction at each phase).
- **Final Inspections**: Conducted upon delivery (e.g., user acceptance testing for software, final walkthrough for construction).

**Acceptance Process**:
1. **Seller submits deliverable** (e.g., software build, report, equipment).
2. **Buyer inspects** against acceptance criteria (defined in the contract).
3. **Buyer issues decision**:
   - **Accept**: Deliverable meets criteria. Payment is triggered (if milestone-based). Seller's obligation is fulfilled.
   - **Reject**: Deliverable does not meet criteria. Seller must remediate (fix defects) and resubmit.
   - **Conditionally Accept**: Minor issues exist. Buyer accepts with a punch list of items to be corrected.

**Example**:
- **Contract**: "Website must load in under 2 seconds on a standard broadband connection."
- **Inspection**: Buyer tests website. Load time is 3.5 seconds.
- **Decision**: **Reject**. Provide detailed test results to seller. Seller optimizes code, resubmits. New load time: 1.8 seconds. **Accept**.

::: warning ⚠️ Common Pitfall
**Never accept deliverables that don't meet acceptance criteria** just to "keep the project moving." Once you accept, you lose leverage. The seller's obligation is satisfied, and you're stuck with a substandard deliverable.

### Contract Administration

**Contract administration** is the ongoing management of the contract relationship.

**Key Activities**:
- **Monitoring compliance**: Ensuring both parties fulfill contractual obligations.
- **Managing changes**: Processing change requests through formal change control.
- **Handling payments**: Approving invoices, ensuring payment occurs per contract terms.
- **Maintaining documentation**: Keeping records of correspondence, decisions, changes, performance data.
- **Managing risks**: Identifying and mitigating procurement-related risks.

#### Change Control in Contracts

Any change to the contract (scope, schedule, price, terms) requires **formal change control**.

**Process**:
1. **Change Request Submitted**: Either party identifies a need for change (e.g., seller proposes adding a feature; buyer requests a schedule acceleration).
2. **Impact Analysis**: Assess impact on scope, schedule, cost, quality, risk.
3. **Negotiation**: Agree on change and any price/schedule adjustments.
4. **Contract Amendment**: Formalize the change in a contract amendment (also called a "change order" or "contract modification").
5. **Implementation**: Execute the change.

**Example**:
- **Original Contract**: Build a 10-page website for $50,000 in 3 months.
- **Change Request**: Buyer wants to add a user login feature (not in original scope).
- **Seller Response**: "Login feature will add $8,000 and 3 weeks to the schedule."
- **Negotiation**: Buyer agrees to $7,000 and 2 weeks.
- **Contract Amendment**: Formal amendment issued. New price: $57,000. New deadline: 3.5 months.

::: tip 💡 Key Principle
**You cannot just "ask" a vendor to do extra work** outside the contract without addressing price and schedule. Even small changes require formal change control to avoid scope creep and disputes.
:::

### Claims Administration & Dispute Resolution

**Claim**: A formal assertion by one party that the other party has failed to meet a contractual obligation, resulting in damages or additional costs.

**Common Claim Scenarios**:
- **Seller claims**: "Buyer delayed providing requirements (per contract Section 4.2), which caused our delay. We're owed a schedule extension and $20,000 in additional costs."
- **Buyer claims**: "Seller delivered defective equipment (fails acceptance criteria in Section 5.1). We're owed a price reduction or replacement."

#### Claims Management Process

1. **Claim Notification**: The claimant (seller or buyer) formally notifies the other party, citing the contract clause and the basis for the claim.
2. **Review & Documentation**: Both parties review the claim, gather evidence (emails, meeting notes, deliverable records, contract terms).
3. **Negotiation**: Attempt to resolve the claim through discussion. Goal: Reach a mutually acceptable settlement.
4. **Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)**: If negotiation fails, use ADR methods:
   - **Mediation**: A neutral third party facilitates discussion but doesn't impose a solution. Non-binding.
   - **Arbitration**: A neutral third party (arbitrator) hears both sides and issues a **binding decision**.
5. **Litigation**: If ADR fails, the dispute goes to court. This is the **last resort** (expensive, time-consuming, damages relationships).

**Example Claim**:
- **Contract Clause**: "Buyer will provide access to the production environment within 5 days of contract signing."
- **Actual**: Buyer provided access after 30 days.
- **Seller Claim**: "Due to the 25-day delay in environment access, our team was idle. We incurred $15,000 in additional costs. We request a contract price increase of $15,000."
- **Resolution**: Buyer reviews records, confirms the delay. Buyer's PM admits fault. Parties negotiate a settlement: Buyer agrees to $10,000 additional payment (compromise). Contract is amended.

#### Constructive Changes

A **constructive change** occurs when the buyer's actions (or inactions) effectively change the scope, even without a formal change order.

**Example**:
- **Contract**: Seller to develop software per specifications in Appendix A.
- **Situation**: Buyer repeatedly rejects deliverables for reasons **not in Appendix A** (e.g., "The button color should be blue, not green"), forcing rework.
- **Seller's Position**: "These rejections constitute a constructive change. We're owed additional payment for the rework."
- **Outcome**: If the seller can prove the rejections were outside the original specifications, they may be entitled to compensation.

::: warning ⚠️ PM Responsibility
**Document everything**. Emails, meeting minutes, inspection reports, change requests. If a claim or dispute arises, **documentation is your defense**. "I think we discussed that" is not evidence; "Here's the email from March 15" is.
:::

### Procurement Closure

When the contract work is complete, you must **formally close** the procurement.

**Steps**:
1. **Final Inspection & Acceptance**: Verify that all deliverables meet acceptance criteria. Issue formal acceptance letter.
2. **Final Payment**: Process final invoice. Ensure all payments are complete.
3. **Close Claims**: Resolve any outstanding claims.
4. **Archive Documentation**: Store all procurement records (contract, amendments, correspondence, inspection reports, payment records) per organizational policy.
5. **Lessons Learned**: Document what went well and what didn't (vendor performance, contract effectiveness, process improvements).
6. **Release Sellers**: Issue formal notice that the contract is complete and the seller is released from further obligations.

**Formal Acceptance vs. Final Payment**:
- **Formal Acceptance**: "We have inspected and accept the deliverables."
- **Final Payment**: "We have paid all amounts due."

Both must occur to fully close the procurement.

**Example**:
- **Contract**: Vendor delivered all 50 servers.
- **Inspection**: All servers passed acceptance testing.
- **Acceptance Letter**: Issued on June 15.
- **Final Invoice**: Received June 20. Approved and paid July 1.
- **Procurement Closed**: July 1 (acceptance + payment complete).

## 📊 Procurement Execution Scenario

**Scenario**: You're managing a project to build a data center. You've awarded a $2M contract to BuildCo to construct the facility. The contract is **Fixed-Price (FP)**, with a 12-month delivery schedule. Here's how procurement execution unfolds:

### Month 1: Kickoff & Performance Monitoring
- **Action**: Hold a kickoff meeting with BuildCo. Review the SOW, schedule, and change control process.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Establish weekly progress meetings. BuildCo provides photos and progress reports.

### Month 4: Inspection
- **Action**: Conduct a mid-construction inspection. Foundation and framing are complete.
- **Inspection Result**: Framing is 6 inches off from blueprint specifications.
- **Response**: Issue a **non-conformance report**. BuildCo must correct the framing at their own cost (FP contract = seller's risk).

### Month 6: Change Request
- **Situation**: You realize you need an additional 10 server racks (not in the original scope).
- **Action**: Submit a change request to BuildCo.
- **BuildCo Response**: "Adding 10 racks will cost $50,000 and add 2 weeks to the schedule."
- **Negotiation**: You negotiate down to $45,000 and 10 days.
- **Contract Amendment**: Formal amendment issued. New contract price: $2.045M. New deadline: 12 months + 10 days.

### Month 10: Claim
- **BuildCo Claim**: "You delayed approving the electrical design by 3 weeks (contract required 5-day approval). This delayed our electricians. We're owed a schedule extension."
- **Review**: You check records. Approval did take 22 days (instead of 5). Delay is valid.
- **Resolution**: You agree to a 2-week schedule extension (compromise). New deadline: 12 months + 10 days + 14 days.

### Month 12.8: Final Inspection & Acceptance
- **Action**: Conduct final walkthrough. All work is complete and meets acceptance criteria.
- **Formal Acceptance**: Issue acceptance letter on Day 380 (12 months + 24 days).
- **Final Payment**: Process final invoice. Payment issued 15 days later.
- **Procurement Closed**: Day 395.

### Lessons Learned
- **What Went Well**: Weekly progress meetings kept communication strong. Fixed-price contract limited cost risk.
- **What Didn't**: Slow approval process caused unnecessary delays. **Improvement**: Implement a 3-day approval SLA for future contracts.

## 🎯 Key Takeaways: Execution Excellence

Successful execution requires mastering three critical domains:

### Team Development & Motivation
- **Tuckman's Stages**: Recognize whether your team is Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing, or Adjourning. Apply appropriate interventions at each stage.
- **Motivation**: Address unmet needs (Maslow), focus on motivators not just hygiene factors (Herzberg), embrace Theory Y leadership (McGregor).
- **Conflict Resolution**: Use **Collaborating** for high-stakes issues, **Compromising** when time is short, **Forcing** only for emergencies or ethics.

### Stakeholder & Communication Management
- **Engagement Levels**: Move stakeholders from Unaware → Resistant → Neutral → Supportive → Leading through targeted actions.
- **The 4 Rs**: Right Information, Right Time, Right Audience, Right Channel.
- **Verification**: Communication only happens when the message is received and understood. Use feedback loops.

### Procurement Execution
- **Fair Selection**: Use objective source selection criteria (weighting systems, screening systems). Share all information equally with bidders.
- **Win-Win Negotiation**: Fair deals for sellers lead to better project outcomes. Negotiate scope, price, schedule, risk allocation, and change control processes.
- **Contract Administration**: Monitor seller performance, conduct inspections, manage changes through formal change control, document everything.
- **Claims & Disputes**: Always start with the contract. Use negotiation, then ADR (mediation/arbitration), litigation is the last resort.
- **Formal Closure**: Final acceptance + final payment + lessons learned.
