# Chapter 8: Execution & Value Delivery

Execution is where strategy meets reality. In the 2026 PMP exam, a Project Manager doesn't just "execute tasks"—they **steward value**. Success is measured not just by a finished product, but by the meaningful outcomes it creates for the customer and the organization.

::: tip PMP Exam Reality (2026)
The 2026 ECO doesn’t have a separate “Execution” domain, but many **Process (41%)** and **Business Environment (26%)** questions are set during execution—where blockers, change requests, vendor delays, and quality issues surface.
:::

::: info What the Exam Tests
Most exam scenarios are execution scenarios: blocked team members, changing stakeholder expectations, quality defects, vendor delays, and "small" change requests. The test is usually about **what you do first** to protect flow and value, not just recognizing the problem.

## Execution Process Groups Overview

The Executing Process Group includes **10 processes** from the PMBOK® Guide, making it the largest process group by count. These processes transform plans into deliverables while managing people, knowledge, quality, resources, communications, stakeholders, risks, and procurements.

### Core Integration Processes

| Process                            | Knowledge Area | Primary Purpose                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Direct and Manage Project Work** | Integration    | Coordinate all execution activities; produce deliverables; collect work performance data |
| **Manage Project Knowledge**       | Integration    | Capture and share explicit/tacit knowledge; enable continuous learning                   |

### Resource & Team Processes

| Process               | Knowledge Area | Primary Purpose                                                         |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Manage Quality**    | Quality        | Translate quality plan into quality activities (audits, reviews, tests) |
| **Acquire Resources** | Resource       | Obtain team members, facilities, equipment, materials needed            |
| **Develop Team**      | Resource       | Improve competencies, interaction, and team environment                 |
| **Manage Team**       | Resource       | Track performance, provide feedback, resolve issues, manage changes     |

### Communication & Stakeholder Processes

| Process                           | Knowledge Area | Primary Purpose                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Manage Communications**         | Communications | Create, collect, distribute, store, retrieve, and dispose of project information |
| **Manage Stakeholder Engagement** | Stakeholder    | Work with stakeholders to meet needs, address issues, foster involvement         |

### Procurement & Risk Processes

| Process                      | Knowledge Area | Primary Purpose                                             |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Conduct Procurements**     | Procurement    | Obtain seller responses, select sellers, award contracts    |
| **Implement Risk Responses** | Risk           | Execute agreed-upon risk response plans when triggers occur |

::: info Execution vs. Monitoring & Controlling
These processes don't happen in isolation—they're constantly informed by Monitoring & Controlling processes. For example, you **Direct and Manage Project Work** (Executing) while simultaneously **Monitoring and Controlling Project Work** (M&C) to detect variances and decide whether corrective action is needed.
:::

---

## How Execution Processes Work Together

Execution is highly integrated—these processes don't happen in isolation. Understanding the relationships between processes helps you answer "what should I do first" questions on the exam.

### The Execution Flow (Typical Sequence)

```

 1. ACQUIRE RESOURCES
 Get the team, equipment, facilities needed

 ↓

 2. DEVELOP TEAM
 Build skills, trust, collaboration

 ↓

 3. DIRECT AND MANAGE PROJECT WORK (continuous)
 Coordinate all execution activities
 Manage Communications (keep stakeholders informed)
 Manage Stakeholder Engagement (work with people)
 Manage Quality (perform quality activities)
 Conduct Procurements (select and contract vendors)
 Implement Risk Responses (execute when triggered)
 Manage Team (address issues, provide feedback)

 ↓

 4. MANAGE PROJECT KNOWLEDGE (continuous)
 Capture lessons learned, share knowledge

```

### Critical Interdependencies

- **Can't manage a team you don't have**: Acquire Resources → Develop Team → Manage Team
- **Can't communicate without a plan**: Plan Communications Management → Manage Communications
- **Can't engage stakeholders without knowing them**: Identify Stakeholders → Plan Stakeholder Engagement → Manage Stakeholder Engagement
- **Can't conduct procurements without requirements**: Plan Procurement Management → Conduct Procurements
- **Quality activities execute the quality plan**: Plan Quality Management → Manage Quality

::: warning Common Exam Trap
If a question asks "What should the PM do first?" and multiple answers seem reasonable, choose the one that follows the **logical dependency chain**. For example, you can't "develop the team" before you "acquire resources" to get the team members assigned.
:::

---

## Key Execution Concepts (Exam-Critical)

Understanding these concepts will help you decode execution scenarios and choose the best answer quickly.

### 1. Work Performance Data → Information → Reports

This is the **information transformation chain** that drives execution decisions:

| Level                            | Definition                                      | Example                                                              | Who uses it            |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Work Performance Data**        | Raw observations and measurements               | Task completion dates, defect counts, hours worked, test results     | Project team           |
| **Work Performance Information** | Analyzed data showing status, trends, forecasts | Schedule variance (SV), cost performance index (CPI), quality trends | Project manager        |
| **Work Performance Reports**     | Formatted communication for stakeholders        | Status reports, dashboards, steering committee presentations         | Stakeholders, sponsors |

**Exam pattern**: If stakeholders are surprised by a problem, you likely collected **data** but failed to transform it into **information** and communicate it via **reports**.

### 2. Approved Change Requests → Execution

Changes don't happen automatically—they flow through a formal process:

```
Change Request → Perform Integrated Change Control → Approved Changes →
Direct and Manage Project Work (implement) → Update Documents/Baselines
```

**Key insight**: In execution, you implement **approved** changes. If someone asks for a change during execution, you don't just do it—you assess impact and follow the change control process (CCB in predictive, backlog refinement in agile).

### 3. Deliverables vs. Outcomes vs. Value

- **Deliverable**: The tangible output (e.g., software module, training manual)
- **Outcome**: The behavioral change or result (e.g., users can self-serve support requests)
- **Value**: The strategic benefit realized (e.g., 30% reduction in support costs)

**Exam trap**: Completing all deliverables ≠ project success. If users don't adopt the solution or benefits aren't realized, value delivery has failed.

### 4. Servant Leadership in Execution

The PM's primary role during execution is **removing impediments** so the team can deliver value:

- Clear blockers (technical, political, resource)
- Shield the team from interruptions
- Facilitate decisions
- Escalate what you can't resolve
- Coach and support (not command and control)

### 5. Progressive Elaboration in Execution

Execution often reveals new information that requires re-planning:

- **Rolling wave planning**: Detailed plans for near-term work, high-level for later work
- **Iterative development**: Build incrementally, learn from each iteration, adapt
- **Continuous planning**: Adjust scope/schedule/priorities based on validated learning

::: info Predictive vs. Adaptive Execution

- **Predictive**: Execute according to the plan; changes require formal change control
- **Adaptive**: Execute the highest-value work; adapt continuously based on feedback
- **Hybrid**: Core deliverables follow predictive governance; component work uses adaptive cycles
  :::

## Emotional Intelligence (EQ) in Execution

Emotional Intelligence is **critical** for project success during execution. Research shows EQ is often a better predictor of PM effectiveness than technical skills.

### Goleman's Five Components of EQ

| Component           | Definition                                                                           | PM Application in Execution                                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Self-Awareness**  | Recognizing your own emotions, strengths, weaknesses, values                         | Know when you're stressed; recognize your biases; ask for feedback                   |
| **Self-Regulation** | Controlling disruptive impulses; thinking before acting                              | Stay calm under pressure; don't react emotionally to bad news; model professionalism |
| **Motivation**      | Drive to achieve beyond expectations; passion for work                               | Set high standards; stay positive during setbacks; inspire the team                  |
| **Empathy**         | Understanding others' emotional makeup; treating people according to their reactions | Listen to stakeholder concerns; recognize team stress; adapt communication style     |
| **Social Skills**   | Building rapport; finding common ground; building networks                           | Influence without authority; resolve conflicts; build coalitions for decisions       |

::: tip Exam Pattern
If a scenario describes a PM who reacts emotionally, makes decisions without listening, or fails to recognize team stress, the answer often involves applying **emotional intelligence skills** (self-regulation, empathy, active listening).
:::

### EQ in Common Execution Scenarios

| Scenario                                   | Low EQ Response                              | High EQ Response                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Team member makes a costly mistake**     | Public criticism; blame assignment           | Private conversation; understand root cause; coach for improvement       |
| **Stakeholder becomes angry about delays** | Defensive justification; minimizing concerns | Acknowledge frustration; actively listen; focus on solutions             |
| **Team conflict escalates in meeting**     | Ignore it or take sides                      | Call a break; facilitate private discussion; address underlying concerns |
| **PM feels overwhelmed by scope changes**  | React with visible stress; snap at team      | Step back; reframe as problem to solve; seek sponsor guidance            |
| **Team morale drops during crunch time**   | Push harder; emphasize deadlines             | Recognize exhaustion; provide support; celebrate small wins              |

## Power Types in Project Execution

PMs often have **responsibility without authority**. Understanding power types helps you influence effectively.

### Five Types of Power

| Power Type                  | Source                           | Example                                     | Effectiveness | Sustainability          |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Legitimate / Positional** | Formal position or title         | "I'm the Project Manager"                   | Medium        | Limited to formal scope |
| **Reward**                  | Ability to give benefits         | Bonuses, recognition, preferred assignments | Medium        | Limited by resources    |
| **Coercive / Penalty**      | Ability to punish                | Threats, poor reviews, removal              | Low           | Builds resentment       |
| **Expert**                  | Knowledge and skills             | "I've done this 10 times successfully"      | High          | Builds respect          |
| **Referent**                | Personal relationships; charisma | "People trust and like me"                  | Highest       | Builds loyalty          |

::: warning PMP Best Practice
Rely on **Expert** and **Referent** power rather than **Coercive** power. Coercive power damages relationships and team morale. The best PMs influence through competence and trust, not threats.
:::

### Power Application During Execution

| Situation                               | Recommended Power Type | Why                                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Negotiating with functional manager** | Expert + Referent      | Build relationship; demonstrate value to their team |
| **Requesting team overtime**            | Referent + Reward      | Personal connection + recognition/compensation      |
| **Enforcing safety standards**          | Legitimate + Expert    | Authority backed by expertise justifies the rule    |
| **Resolving technical dispute**         | Expert                 | Technical credibility earns trust in decision       |
| **Urgent escalation to sponsor**        | Legitimate + Expert    | Position gives access; expertise gives credibility  |

---

## Communications Channels Formula

During execution, communication complexity increases with team size. The **Communications Channels Formula** helps you plan communication overhead.

### Formula

```
Channels = n(n-1) ÷ 2
```

Where **n** = number of stakeholders/team members

### Examples

| Team Size (n) | Calculation | Channels | Impact                            |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| 5             | 5 × 4 ÷ 2   | 10       | Manageable                        |
| 10            | 10 × 9 ÷ 2  | 45       | Moderate complexity               |
| 15            | 15 × 14 ÷ 2 | 105      | High complexity                   |
| 20            | 20 × 19 ÷ 2 | 190      | Very high complexity              |
| 50            | 50 × 49 ÷ 2 | 1,225    | Requires structured communication |

::: tip Exam Application
If a question asks about communication complexity when **adding team members**, calculate the before/after channel count:

- Team of 10: 45 channels
- Add 2 members (now 12): 12 × 11 ÷ 2 = **66 channels** (47% increase!)

Adding just 2 people to a 10-person team creates 21 new communication paths.
:::

### Reducing Communication Overhead

When channels become unwieldy:

- **Hierarchical communication**: Team leads summarize to PM; PM reports to stakeholders
- **Structured meetings**: Replace ad-hoc channels with planned touchpoints
- **Information radiators**: Dashboards, boards, status pages (pull vs. push)
- **Communication matrix**: Define who needs what information and when

## Driving Performance (Without Losing Value)

Execution is where you turn plans and backlogs into real deliverables. It requires balancing:

- **Discipline** (baselines, policies, governance, quality standards)
- **Adaptability** (feedback loops, fast decisions, removing blockers)
- **People leadership** (coaching, conflict resolution, stakeholder alignment)

### What this chapter makes you exam-ready for

- Removing **impediments** while protecting team focus (servant leadership)
- Turning noise into insight (work performance **data → information → reports**)
- Managing **issues, risks, and changes** without “death by a thousand cuts”
- Proving value via **outcomes, benefits, and adoption** (not just deliverables)

### High-yield artifacts and “first moves” (execution quick picks)

| If a question says…                         | Think…          | Best first move                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| “A team member is blocked”                  | Impediment      | Remove/escalate blocker immediately; update impediment/issue log         |
| “A risk occurred”                           | Issue now       | Execute response → log as issue → assess impact                          |
| “Stakeholder asks for a small change”       | Change control  | Triage the request; assess impacts; follow change process/backlog rules  |
| “We met requirements but users are unhappy” | Validation gap  | Re-engage users; clarify outcomes; adjust acceptance criteria/priorities |
| “Operations won’t accept handoff”           | Transition risk | Close readiness gaps (training, support, documentation) before closure   |

## Predictive vs. Adaptive Execution (Detailed Comparison)

The 2026 PMP exam expects you to recognize the appropriate execution approach based on project context: uncertainty, requirements stability, stakeholder availability, and organizational culture.

### Execution Approach Comparison

| Dimension                   | Predictive Execution                            | Adaptive Execution                                 | Hybrid Execution                                      |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Planning horizon**        | Comprehensive upfront plan for entire project   | Plan 1-4 weeks at a time (sprint/iteration)        | Predictive roadmap + adaptive increments              |
| **Requirements**            | Defined early; changes via CCB                  | Emergent; refined continuously                     | Core requirements fixed; details adaptive             |
| **Work authorization**      | Work authorization system; tasks per schedule   | Pull system; team self-organizes from backlog      | Milestones/gates + team pull within boundaries        |
| **Change approach**         | Formal change control (Change Control Board)    | Backlog refinement; prioritize new work            | CCB for scope/budget; backlog for details             |
| **Team structure**          | Functional/matrix; PM directs work              | Cross-functional; self-organizing                  | Mix of functional specialists + agile pods            |
| **Progress tracking**       | Milestones, % complete, earned value (EVM)      | Velocity, burndown/burnup, working software        | EVM for overall project + velocity for sprints        |
| **Stakeholder involvement** | Periodic reviews at phase gates                 | Continuous (sprint reviews, daily availability)    | Steering gates + frequent increment reviews           |
| **Quality approach**        | Quality gates, formal inspections, audits       | Built-in (DoD, peer reviews, TDD, CI/CD)           | Quality gates for releases + built-in practices       |
| **Risk management**         | Identify risks upfront; execute response plans  | Reduce risk via small increments + feedback        | Core risks managed predictively; learn via iterations |
| **Documentation**           | Comprehensive (contracts, specs, baselines)     | Minimal viable (user stories, working software)    | Contracts + lightweight working docs                  |
| **When to use**             | Low uncertainty, stable requirements, fixed bid | High uncertainty, unclear requirements, innovation | Complex integration + some uncertain components       |

### Execution Cadence Comparison

| Activity                  | Predictive                        | Adaptive                               | Hybrid                                    |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Daily touchpoint**      | Optional standups or none         | Daily standup (mandatory)              | Daily standup for agile teams             |
| **Work review**           | Phase gate reviews (weeks/months) | Sprint review every 1-4 weeks          | Sprint reviews + quarterly steering gates |
| **Retrospective**         | Post-project lessons learned      | Sprint retrospective (every iteration) | Sprint retros + phase retrospectives      |
| **Planning cycle**        | Annual or phase-based             | Sprint planning every iteration        | Release planning + sprint planning        |
| **Stakeholder reporting** | Monthly status reports            | Sprint review demos + dashboards       | Sprint reviews + monthly steering reports |

### Best First Moves (Execution Quick Reference)

| Scenario                          | Predictive                                                          | Adaptive                                                                     | Hybrid                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Stakeholder requests scope change | Assess impact → submit change request → CCB review → approve/reject | Discuss with Product Owner → prioritize in backlog → refine in next planning | Assess if core scope (CCB) or detail (backlog)       |
| Team member blocked by issue      | Log issue → assign owner → escalate if needed → update schedule     | Remove impediment immediately → update board → continue flow                 | Remove impediment + assess baseline impact           |
| Requirements unclear              | Document assumption → get sponsor approval → baseline it            | Defer to later sprint → validate with users first → refine                   | Clarify must-haves now; defer details to sprints     |
| Quality defect found              | Log defect → assess impact → fix or defer via CCB                   | Fix in current sprint if DoD broken; backlog if not                          | Critical defects fixed immediately; minor to backlog |
| Risk occurs (becomes issue)       | Execute risk response plan → log as issue → assess variance         | Adapt priority/scope → collaborate on solution → continue                    | Execute response + assess if re-planning needed      |

::: tip Exam Strategy: Match the Approach to the Context
If a scenario describes **changing requirements, user feedback, innovation**, lean toward **adaptive** answers (collaborate, iterate, demos). If it describes **contracts, fixed budgets, compliance**, lean toward **predictive** answers (CCB, baselines, formal approvals).

## Integration with Other Process Groups

Execution doesn't happen in isolation—it's constantly informed by and feeding back to other process groups. Understanding these connections helps you answer integration questions on the exam.

### Initiating → Executing

| From Initiating      | How It Guides Execution                                 | Example                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Project Charter      | Provides high-level scope, objectives, success criteria | Team references charter to resolve scope disputes |
| Stakeholder Register | Identifies who needs to be engaged                      | PM uses register to plan engagement activities    |
| Assumption Log       | Documents what's uncertain or presumed true             | Team validates assumptions during execution       |

**Key connection**: The **Project Charter** authorizes the project and the PM. During execution, it serves as the "constitution" for resolving disagreements about scope or authority.

### Planning → Executing

| From Planning                     | How It Guides Execution                     | Example                                                        |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| All Management Plans              | Define "how" execution will work            | Communications Plan guides when/how to send status reports     |
| Baselines (Scope, Schedule, Cost) | Define the approved plan to execute against | Team delivers per scope baseline; changes require CCB approval |
| Requirements Documentation        | Specifies what to build                     | Team builds features per requirements; validates against them  |
| Risk Register                     | Lists threats/opportunities to monitor      | PM implements risk responses when triggers occur               |
| Stakeholder Engagement Plan       | Defines desired engagement levels           | PM works to move resisters to supportive                       |

**Key connection**: Execution **implements the plans**. If something isn't working, you don't just ignore the plan—you use **change control** or **adaptive refinement** to update it.

### Executing ↔ Monitoring & Controlling (Continuous Loop)

This is the most critical integration—execution and monitoring happen **simultaneously**.

```

 EXECUTING PROCESS GROUP
 Direct and Manage Project Work
 Produces: Deliverables, Work Performance Data

 ↓ (Work Performance Data)

 MONITORING & CONTROLLING PROCESS GROUP
 Monitor and Control Project Work
 Analyzes data → Creates Work Performance Information
 Compares to baselines → Identifies variances
 Recommends: Corrective/Preventive Actions, Changes

 ↓ (Approved Change Requests, Corrective Actions)

 EXECUTING PROCESS GROUP
 Direct and Manage Project Work
 Implements approved changes and corrective actions

```

| Monitoring & Controlling Process     | What It Measures                              | Executing Process Response                                    |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Monitor and Control Project Work** | Overall project performance against baselines | Implement approved corrective/preventive actions              |
| **Validate Scope**                   | Deliverable acceptance by customer/sponsor    | Rework rejected deliverables; update acceptance criteria      |
| **Control Scope**                    | Scope creep and unauthorized changes          | Implement only approved scope changes via CCB                 |
| **Control Schedule**                 | Schedule variance and critical path           | Implement schedule compression (crash/fast-track) if approved |
| **Control Costs**                    | Cost variance and budget consumption          | Implement cost-reduction measures if approved                 |
| **Control Quality**                  | Defect rates and quality metrics              | Rework defects; implement quality improvements                |
| **Control Resources**                | Resource utilization and availability         | Acquire additional resources; re-assign team members          |
| **Monitor Communications**           | Communication effectiveness                   | Adjust communication methods based on feedback                |
| **Monitor Risks**                    | Risk triggers and new risks                   | Implement risk responses when triggers occur                  |
| **Control Procurements**             | Vendor performance against contract           | Address vendor issues; execute contract changes               |
| **Monitor Stakeholder Engagement**   | Engagement level changes                      | Increase engagement activities for resisters                  |

**Exam insight**: Many scenarios present a problem discovered during monitoring (variance, defect, stakeholder issue) and ask "what should you do?" The answer often involves **returning to execution** to implement the corrective action.

### Executing → Closing

| Execution Output                 | How It Enables Closing                 | Example                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Accepted Deliverables            | Required for formal project closure    | Customer accepts final product → enables closure            |
| Lessons Learned Register         | Captures knowledge for future projects | Team documents what worked/didn't work throughout execution |
| Final Product/Service Transition | Hands off to operations                | Training complete, SOPs updated, support team ready         |
| Updated Project Documents        | Provides as-built documentation        | Final schedule, actual costs, risk log closure              |

**Key connection**: You can't close what you haven't delivered. **Validate Scope** (M&C) confirms deliverables meet acceptance criteria, then **Close Project/Phase** (Closing) formally ends the work.

### Cross-Process Group Integration: Real Scenario

**Scenario**: During execution, you discover that a key requirement was misunderstood and the deliverable won't meet stakeholder needs.

**Process group flow**:

1. **Executing**: Team produces deliverable per requirements (Direct and Manage Project Work)
2. **Monitoring & Controlling**: Stakeholder review identifies the gap (Validate Scope - rejected)
3. **Monitoring & Controlling**: Assess impact and root cause (Monitor and Control Project Work)
4. **Monitoring & Controlling**: Submit change request to correct requirements (Perform Integrated Change Control)
5. **Planning**: Update requirements documentation and baselines (if approved)
6. **Executing**: Rework deliverable per updated requirements (Direct and Manage Project Work)
7. **Monitoring & Controlling**: Re-validate with stakeholder (Validate Scope - accepted)
8. **Closing**: Formally accept and close (Close Project or Phase)

::: tip Exam Pattern
Questions that say "during execution, you discover..." often test whether you know to **stop, assess, and potentially update the plan** (via M&C processes) before continuing execution. Don't just "push through" when the plan is wrong.

## 2026 Focus: Impediments + Value at Risk

On the exam, execution questions often hide a simple truth: **value is threatened** because flow is blocked, quality is slipping, or adoption is failing. Your job is to:

- **Clear the path**: Remove blockers fast (or escalate) so work can continue.
- **Protect the system**: Use logs, cadences, and policies so you don't "wing it" under pressure.
- **Manage knowledge continuously**: Update the lessons learned register during execution, not after.
- **Adapt with intent**: Re-plan/re-prioritize when value delivery is at risk, using the right governance.
