# 6.7 Communications Planning

**ECO Task**: Plan and manage communication

Communication is the **oil that keeps the project machine running**. The PM spends approximately 90% of their time communicating—yet poor communication remains the leading cause of project failure.

## 🧭 The Communications Planning Flow

### Step 1: Plan Communications Management
**Purpose**: Determine stakeholder information needs and define communication approach
**Key Outputs**:
- Communications Management Plan
- Communication methods and technologies
- Update frequency schedules

### Communication Planning Inputs

| Input | Use |
|:------|:----|
| **Stakeholder Register** | Who needs information |
| **Stakeholder Engagement Plan** | How to engage each |
| **Organizational Process Assets** | Templates, lessons learned |
| **Enterprise Environmental Factors** | Culture, technology, regulations |

---

## 📋 Communications Management Plan

The Communications Management Plan documents:

| Component | Description | Example |
|:----------|:------------|:--------|
| **Stakeholder Information Needs** | What each stakeholder needs | Sponsor: project status, issues, decisions |
| **Information to Communicate** | What content is shared | Status reports, risk updates, milestone reports |
| **Reason for Distribution** | Why this communication | Regulatory requirement, stakeholder request |
| **Timeframe/Frequency** | When/how often | Weekly, daily, on-change |
| **Responsible Party** | Who creates/sends | PM, Team Lead, PMO |
| **Recipients** | Who receives | Sponsor, Steering Committee, Team |
| **Methods/Technologies** | How delivered | Email, meeting, dashboard |
| **Escalation Procedures** | How issues are escalated | Time-based, severity-based |
| **Glossary** | Common terms defined | Avoiding misunderstanding |

## 📊 Communication Methods

### By Communication Type

| Type | Description | Examples | Best For |
|:-----|:------------|:---------|:---------|
| **Interactive** | Real-time, two-way | Meetings, calls, video, face-to-face | Complex topics, relationship building, problem-solving |
| **Push** | One-way distribution | Email, reports, letters, memos | Updates, FYI, documentation |
| **Pull** | Recipient-initiated | Intranet, wiki, shared drives | Reference, large audience, self-service |

### By Formality

| Level | Examples | When to Use |
|:------|:---------|:------------|
| **Formal Written** | Contracts, reports, legal documents | Audit trail, legal, complex |
| **Formal Verbal** | Presentations, speeches | Large audiences, important announcements |
| **Informal Written** | Email, chat, notes | Day-to-day coordination |
| **Informal Verbal** | Hallway conversations, calls | Quick coordination, relationship building |

### Communication Channel Calculation

**Formula**: Number of channels = **n(n-1)/2**

Where n = number of people

| Team Size | Channels | Complexity |
|:----------|:---------|:-----------|
| 2 | 1 | Low |
| 5 | 10 | Low |
| 10 | 45 | Medium |
| 15 | 105 | High |
| 20 | 190 | Very High |

::: warning ⚠️ Exam Trap
When a question says "a new team member is added," calculate the NEW number of channels, not the additional channels. If n goes from 5 to 6: new channels = 6(5)/2 = **15** (not 5 more).

## 🎭 Communication Models

### Basic Communication Model

```
┌──────────┐    Encode    ┌───────────┐    Decode    ┌──────────┐
│  Sender  │ ──────────→  │  Message  │ ──────────→  │ Receiver │
└──────────┘              └───────────┘              └──────────┘
     ↑                                                     │
     │              ← ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─             │
     └─────────────────  Feedback/Response  ──────────────┘
                              Noise
```

### Model Components

| Component | Description | PM Responsibility |
|:----------|:------------|:------------------|
| **Sender** | Creates the message | Choose appropriate words/format |
| **Encode** | Convert thoughts to message | Use proper language, avoid jargon |
| **Message** | The communication itself | Clear, concise, complete |
| **Medium** | Channel used | Match medium to message type |
| **Decode** | Interpret the message | Verify understanding |
| **Receiver** | Gets the message | Actively listen |
| **Noise** | Interference | Minimize distractions |
| **Feedback** | Response/acknowledgment | Confirm understanding |

### Communication Barriers (Noise)

| Barrier Type | Examples | Mitigation |
|:-------------|:---------|:-----------|
| **Physical** | Distance, poor audio, noisy environment | Better technology, quiet spaces |
| **Semantic** | Jargon, language differences | Define terms, avoid acronyms |
| **Cultural** | Different norms, values | Cultural awareness training |
| **Psychological** | Bias, emotions, stress | Active listening, empathy |
| **Technical** | System failures, poor tools | Backup systems, training |

## 🌐 Communication in Virtual/Distributed Teams

### Virtual Team Communication Challenges

| Challenge | Impact | Solution |
|:----------|:-------|:---------|
| **Time zones** | Scheduling difficulties | Rotating meeting times, async |
| **Cultural differences** | Misunderstandings | Cultural sensitivity training |
| **Lack of visual cues** | Missed body language | Video when possible |
| **Technology issues** | Connectivity problems | Backup communication plans |
| **Isolation** | Reduced team cohesion | Virtual team building |

### Virtual Communication Best Practices

1. **Default to video** for meetings when possible
2. **Use asynchronous tools** for information sharing (not just meetings)
3. **Document decisions** in writing (not just verbal)
4. **Establish communication norms** (response time expectations, core overlap hours)
5. **Schedule regular touchpoints** (daily standups, weekly syncs)
6. **Create informal interaction opportunities** (virtual coffee breaks)

## 🔧 Effective Communication Techniques

### Active Listening

| Technique | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| **Pay full attention** | Remove distractions, make eye contact |
| **Paraphrase** | "So what you're saying is..." |
| **Ask clarifying questions** | "Can you elaborate on...?" |
| **Summarize** | "Let me make sure I understand..." |
| **Acknowledge emotions** | "I can see this is frustrating..." |
| **Avoid interrupting** | Let the speaker complete thoughts |

### Giving Effective Feedback

**SBI Model:**
- **S**ituation: When/where did it happen?
- **B**ehavior: What specifically did they do?
- **I**mpact: What was the effect?

**Example**: "In yesterday's meeting (S), when you interrupted the developer (B), it discouraged them from sharing other ideas (I)."

### Running Effective Meetings

**Before:**
- Define purpose and desired outcomes
- Create and distribute agenda
- Invite only necessary participants
- Prepare materials in advance

**During:**
- Start and end on time
- Follow the agenda
- Assign a facilitator and note-taker
- Park off-topic items
- Capture action items with owners and due dates

**After:**
- Distribute meeting notes within 24 hours
- Follow up on action items
- Evaluate meeting effectiveness

## 🧠 Communication Planning Scenarios (Exam Practice)

### Scenario 1: New Team Member
**Situation**: A 10-person project adds one new team member. How many communication channels now exist?
**Answer**: n(n-1)/2 = 11(10)/2 = **55 channels**

### Scenario 2: Misunderstanding
**Situation**: A stakeholder claims they never received important project information.
**Answer**: Review the **Communications Management Plan** to verify what was supposed to be communicated, to whom, and how. Check if the agreed method was followed.

### Scenario 3: Cultural Barrier
**Situation**: A team member from a high-context culture isn't speaking up in meetings.
**Answer**: Use **interactive communication** in a smaller setting; actively invite input; use written channels for those who prefer time to compose thoughts.

### Scenario 4: Stakeholder Overload
**Situation**: The sponsor complains about receiving too many emails.
**Answer**: Review and consolidate communications. Use a **weekly summary** instead of daily updates. Match communication frequency to stakeholder preferences.

### Scenario 5: Remote Team Issues
**Situation**: Distributed team productivity is declining due to communication breakdowns.
**Answer**: Establish **communication norms** (core hours, response expectations), increase use of **video**, implement **regular synchronous touchpoints**.

### Scenario 6: Sensitive Message
**Situation**: The PM needs to communicate a difficult project decision.
**Answer**: Use **formal, interactive communication** (meeting, video call) for sensitive topics. Follow up with written summary. Allow time for questions.
