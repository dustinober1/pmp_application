# Chapter 6: Project Planning

Planning is not a one-time event; it is a **continuous process of refinement**. In the 2026 PMP exam, planning spans the spectrum from detailed predictive baselines to iterative agile backlogs.

---

## Why Planning Matters for the PMP Exam

The planning domain represents approximately **25% of the PMP exam** content. More importantly, planning questions often integrate multiple knowledge areas simultaneously:

- A scope question might require schedule analysis
- A cost question might involve resource constraints
- A procurement question might trigger risk considerations

The exam tests your ability to **think systemically** about planning—recognizing that every planning decision creates ripples across the entire project.

### 2026 Exam Emphasis Areas

The 2026 PMP exam places special emphasis on:

1. **Adaptive Planning**: Understanding when to use predictive vs. agile vs. hybrid approaches
2. **Value-Driven Delivery**: Optimizing for outcomes, not just outputs
3. **Integrated Change Management**: How scope/schedule/cost/quality changes interrelate
4. **Stakeholder-Centric Planning**: Building plans that account for stakeholder expectations
5. **Sustainability (ESG)**: Environmental and social considerations in planning decisions

---

## The Planning Core

Strategic planning is about creating an integrated **Project Management Plan** that balances the competing needs of scope, schedule, cost, quality, and resources.

### The Project Management Plan (Integration)

The **Project Management Plan** is the master document that describes how the project will be executed, monitored, and controlled. It includes:

**Component Plans (How you'll manage each knowledge area):**

- Scope Management Plan
- Schedule Management Plan
- Cost Management Plan
- Quality Management Plan
- Resource Management Plan
- Communications Management Plan
- Risk Management Plan
- Procurement Management Plan
- Stakeholder Engagement Plan

**Baselines (Performance measurement targets):**

- Scope Baseline (Scope Statement + WBS + WBS Dictionary)
- Schedule Baseline (Approved schedule model)
- Cost Baseline (Time-phased budget for EVM)

**Supporting Documents:**

- Requirements documentation, RTM, activity lists, resource calendars, cost estimates, assumptions log, and more

::: tip Exam Reality Check
When a question mentions "the project management plan," it's referring to this integrated document—not just a Gantt chart. Changes to baselines require formal change control. Changes to subsidiary plans may only require PM approval (check the Change Management Plan).
:::

### Component Plan Overview

Each subsidiary management plan answers specific questions:

## What Planning Produces (PMP Reality)

On the exam and in practice, planning creates a **system of documents** that all support each other:

- **Baselines (approved targets)**: Scope Baseline, Schedule Baseline, Cost Baseline
- **Subsidiary plans (how you'll manage)**: Scope/Schedule/Cost/Resource/Procurement Management Plans
- **Supporting documents (details & evidence)**: RTM, activity list, network logic, resource calendars, cost estimates, assumptions log

::: tip Baseline vs. Draft
If a question says a plan is **approved** or **baselined**, changes require formal **change control**. If it says **draft**, you're still refining.
:::

### The Baseline Trio (Performance Measurement Baseline)

The **Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB)** combines three baselines:

```

 PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT BASELINE


 SCOPE SCHEDULE COST
 BASELINE BASELINE BASELINE

 • Scope • Approved • Time-
 Statement Start/End phased
 • WBS Dates Budget
 • WBS Dict • Milestones • S-Curve


```

---

## Planning Process Groups: The Flow

Planning in PMBOK follows a logical sequence (though in reality, iteration is constant):

### Phase 1: Scope Planning

1. **Plan Scope Management** → Define how scope will be managed
2. **Collect Requirements** → Gather stakeholder needs
3. **Define Scope** → Create the scope statement
4. **Create WBS** → Decompose work into manageable pieces

### Phase 2: Schedule Planning

5. **Plan Schedule Management** → Define how schedule will be managed
6. **Define Activities** → Break down work packages
7. **Sequence Activities** → Establish dependencies
8. **Estimate Durations** → Determine time needed
9. **Develop Schedule** → Create the schedule model

### Phase 3: Cost Planning

10. **Plan Cost Management** → Define how costs will be managed
11. **Estimate Costs** → Determine activity costs
12. **Determine Budget** → Aggregate costs into baseline

### Phase 4: Quality, Resource & Risk Planning

13. **Plan Quality Management** → Define quality standards and metrics
14. **Plan Resource Management** → Define how resources will be managed
15. **Estimate Activity Resources** → Determine resource needs
16. **Plan Risk Management** → Define risk approach, conduct identification, analysis, and response planning
17. **Plan Procurement Management** → Define make-or-buy decisions
18. **Plan Communications** → Define information distribution
19. **Plan Stakeholder Engagement** → Define engagement strategies

::: info Iterative Reality
While the PMBOK presents these sequentially, real projects iterate constantly. You might estimate costs, realize you can't afford the scope, then go back and refine requirements. This is **progressive elaboration**, not poor planning.

## 2026 Mindset: The Integrated Plan

A project falls apart when plans exist in silos. Integration means:

- **Scope** changes trigger **Schedule** updates
- **Cost** limits force **Scope** prioritization
- **Resource** availability dictates **Schedule** feasibility
- **Risk** responses may require **Budget** adjustments
- **Quality** requirements drive **Resource** needs

### The Triple Constraint Is Now a Hexagon

Traditional PM taught the "triple constraint" (scope, time, cost). Modern PM recognizes six competing constraints:

```
 Quality
 / \
 Scope — — Resources
 \ /
 Time—Cost—Risk
```

Every planning decision affects multiple constraints. The PM's job is to **optimize for value**, not just balance a triangle.

### Integration Decision Framework

When a change impacts multiple constraints, use this decision sequence:

1. **Assess Impact**: What baselines are affected?
2. **Quantify Trade-offs**: What is gained vs. lost?
3. **Evaluate Alternatives**: Are there ways to minimize negative impacts?
4. **Engage Stakeholders**: Who needs to approve or be informed?
5. **Document Decision**: Update logs, baselines, and communication plans

## Planning Approaches: Predictive vs. Adaptive

| Aspect              | Predictive (Waterfall)                     | Adaptive (Agile)                          | Hybrid                               |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **When to use**     | Stable requirements, regulatory compliance | High uncertainty, rapid change            | Mixed requirements stability         |
| **Scope detail**    | Detailed upfront (WBS)                     | High-level roadmap + iterative refinement | Phased detail                        |
| **Schedule**        | Gantt chart with milestones                | Fixed sprints, flexible scope             | Predictive phases + agile iterations |
| **Cost**            | Detailed budget with reserves              | Budget by iteration or release            | Fixed budget, flexible scope         |
| **Changes**         | Formal change control                      | Continuous backlog refinement             | Tiered change authority              |
| **Success measure** | On-time, on-budget, to-spec                | Value delivered, customer satisfaction    | Outcomes + output metrics            |

::: tip Hybrid Reality
Most 2026 projects use **Hybrid approaches**. You might use predictive planning for compliance-heavy infrastructure work while using agile sprints for the software layer. The exam will test your ability to choose the right approach for the context.
:::

### Suitability Matrix for Approach Selection

| Project Characteristic                   | Predictive | Agile | Hybrid |
| :--------------------------------------- | :--------- | :---- | :----- |
| **Clear, stable requirements**           |            |       |        |
| **High uncertainty/innovation**          |            |       |        |
| **Regulatory compliance critical**       |            |       |        |
| **Frequent stakeholder feedback needed** |            |       |        |
| **Fixed deadline, flexible scope**       |            |       |        |
| **Fixed scope, flexible timeline**       |            |       |        |

## Progressive Elaboration: Planning Over Time

You don't need perfect information on Day 1. Planning evolves as you learn:

**Project Initiation (High-Level):**

- Business case and benefits
- High-level scope and objectives
- Rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimates (−25% to +75%)

**Early Planning (Medium Detail):**

- Detailed requirements for Phase 1
- Near-term activities decomposed
- Budget estimates (−10% to +25%)

**Detailed Planning (Precision):**

- Work packages fully defined
- Activity-level schedules
- Definitive estimates (−5% to +10%)

This is called **Rolling Wave Planning**: near-term work is detailed, future work remains at a higher level until you know more.

### Estimate Accuracy Ranges

| Estimation Phase                   | Range        | When Used                        |
| :--------------------------------- | :----------- | :------------------------------- |
| **ROM (Rough Order of Magnitude)** | −25% to +75% | Initiation, feasibility          |
| **Budget Estimate**                | −10% to +25% | Early planning, funding approval |
| **Definitive Estimate**            | −5% to +10%  | Detailed planning, baselining    |

::: tip Study Recommendation
On the exam, focus on **Progressive Elaboration**. You don't know everything on Day 1. Planning should grow more detailed as you learn more about the project environment. This is not "poor planning"—it's smart risk management in uncertain environments.

## Common Planning Pitfalls (Exam Scenarios)

The exam often presents scenarios where planning has gone wrong. Recognize these patterns:

### 1. Planning Without Sufficient Input

**Symptom**: Scope baseline challenged by stakeholders after approval
**Root Cause**: Inadequate requirements gathering or stakeholder engagement
**Solution**: Use facilitated workshops, prototyping, and iterative validation

### 2. Over-Planning (Analysis Paralysis)

**Symptom**: Team spends months planning without delivering value
**Root Cause**: Fear of uncertainty or perfectionism
**Solution**: Rolling wave planning, timeboxed planning activities

### 3. Under-Planning (Cowboy Coding)

**Symptom**: Constant rework, missed requirements, budget overruns
**Root Cause**: Skipping planning to "move fast"
**Solution**: Minimum viable planning based on project risk

### 4. Siloed Planning

**Symptom**: Schedule conflicts, resource contention, integration failures
**Root Cause**: Plans developed in isolation without cross-functional input
**Solution**: Integrated planning sessions, cross-functional reviews

### 5. Static Planning

**Symptom**: Plans become irrelevant as conditions change
**Root Cause**: Treating baselines as unchangeable
**Solution**: Regular re-planning cadence, change control, continuous improvement
