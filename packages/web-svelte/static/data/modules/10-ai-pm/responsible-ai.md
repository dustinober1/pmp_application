Rule: Never put sensitive data (PII, Financials, IP, Strategy) into a public, free AI model (like standard ChatGPT). It may be used to train the model.
Rule: AI is trained on history. If history was biased (e.g., hiring practices), the AI will be biased. You must actively audit outputs for fairness.
Rule: The AI is a tool, like a calculator. If a bridge collapses because of a calculation error, the engineer is blamed, not the calculator.
