# 5.4 Delivery Strategy

**ECO Task**: Determine appropriate project methodology/methods and practices

One of the PM's first "process" decisions is selecting the high-level delivery strategy. In 2026, this is not a religious choice between Scrum or Predictive—it is a logical choice based on **Risk** and **Frequency of Value**.

---

## 🧭 The Selection Matrix

Use these diagnostic markers to choose the right path for your project.

**Predictive**
Best for **Stable** environments with known solutions.
*   High cost of change
*   Single final release
*   Detailed upfront planning
*   Clear, stable requirements

**Adaptive (Agile)**
Best for **Volatile** environments with emerging requirements.
*   Low cost of change
*   Frequent incremental releases
*   Continuous planning (Sprints)
*   Evolving requirements

**Hybrid**
Best for **Complex** projects with mixed characteristics.
*   Stable foundation / Agile features
*   Predictive dates / Agile path
*   Gated releases
*   Regulatory + innovation mix

## 🎯 Decision Framework: Stacey Matrix

The **Stacey Matrix** helps determine complexity based on requirements clarity and technical certainty:

|                   | **Requirements CLEAR** | **Requirements UNCLEAR** |
| :---------------- | :--------------------- | :----------------------- |
| **Technology KNOWN** | **Simple** → Predictive | **Complicated** → Hybrid |
| **Technology UNKNOWN** | **Complicated** → Hybrid | **Complex** → Agile      |

### Stacey Matrix Decision Guide

| Zone         | Characteristics                          | Best Approach                   |
| :----------- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| **Simple**   | Known requirements, proven technology    | Predictive with standard processes |
| **Complicated** | Expertise needed, analysis required      | Hybrid with expert consultation |
| **Complex**  | Emergent patterns, experimentation needed | Agile with empirical loops      |
| **Chaotic**  | Novel situation, immediate action needed | Rapid response, then stabilize  |

## 🔄 Cynefin Framework

Another powerful complexity model for approach selection:

**Clear (Obvious)**
**Sense → Categorize → Respond**
Best practices apply. Predictive works well.

**Complicated**
**Sense → Analyze → Respond**
Expert analysis needed. Hybrid approach.

**Complex**
**Probe → Sense → Respond**
Experimentation required. Agile approach.

**Chaotic**
**Act → Sense → Respond**
Crisis mode. Act first, then stabilize.

## 🎛️ What the Strategy Choice Changes

Your delivery strategy sets expectations for *how planning, change, and delivery will work*.

| Aspect             | Predictive              | Agile                  | Hybrid                 |
| :----------------- | :---------------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------- |
| **Planning**       | Upfront, detailed       | Rolling wave, iterative | Phased with iteration  |
| **Scope Definition** | WBS, work packages      | Product backlog, user stories | Mixed artifacts        |
| **Change Handling** | Formal change control   | Reprioritization in backlogs | Gates + flexibility    |
| **Value Delivery** | Single release          | Frequent increments    | Staged releases        |
| **Progress Measure** | % complete              | Working increments     | Milestone + velocity   |
| **Risk Response**  | Planned reserves        | Continuous adaptation  | Hybrid approach        |

::: tip 🧠 Exam Pattern
If stakeholders need **frequent feedback** and requirements are evolving, an adaptive approach is usually best. If the environment is **safety-critical** or **highly regulated**, predictive guardrails increase control and auditability.

## 🛠️ Tailoring Factors

When determining the strategy during initiation, consider the **Tailoring Matrix**:

| Factor                   | Predictive Indicators     | Agile Indicators            |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------ | :-------------------------- |
| **Complexity**           | Low, well-understood      | High, many unknowns         |
| **Risk**                 | Failure is catastrophic   | Can fail fast & learn       |
| **Delivery Frequency**   | Single release acceptable | Frequent value needed       |
| **Resource Model**       | Shared resources          | Dedicated cross-functional team |
| **Requirements**         | Stable, well-defined      | Volatile, emerging          |
| **Compliance**           | Heavy documentation needed | Light documentation acceptable |
| **Stakeholder Availability** | Limited access            | Active engagement           |
| **External Dependencies** | Vendor lead times critical | Internal focus              |

## 🧪 Suitability Assessment

### Project Suitability Scorecard

Rate each factor 1-5 and calculate totals:

| Factor                   | Predictive | Agile      |
| :----------------------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| Requirements stability   | +1 per point | -1 per point |
| Customer availability    | -1 per point | +1 per point |
| Cost of change           | +1 per point | -1 per point |
| Team experience with approach | +1 if familiar | +1 if familiar |
| Regulatory requirements  | +1 per point | -1 per point |
| Need for early value     | -1 per point | +1 per point |

**Interpretation:**
*   Higher Predictive score → Lean Predictive
*   Higher Agile score → Lean Agile
*   Similar scores → Consider Hybrid

---

::: info 💡 The 2026 Standard
Most modern enterprise projects are **Hybrid**. They use Predictive milestones for the "Business Case" and "Go-Live" while allowing teams to use Agile "Sprints" for execution and refinement.
