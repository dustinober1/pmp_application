Events you want to Avoid, Mitigate, or Transfer.

- Resource shortage: Key architect gets sick.
- Scope creep: New requirements keep appearing.
- Technical debt: Platform is less stable than expected.
  Events you want to Exploit, Enhance, or Share.
- Efficiency gain: Team discovers a faster method.
- Cost reduction: Vendor offers bulk pricing.
- Innovation: New tech solves the problem better.
  The combined effect of all uncertainty. Two projects can have the same specific risks, but one might be much riskier overall due to complexity, political environment, or strict constraints.
  Rank risks (e.g., High/Medium/Low) using a Probability/Impact Matrix. Also consider Urgency (how soon?) and Proximity (how close?).
  Crucial Step: Risk Data Quality Assessment. Before believing the data, ask: "Is this risk data accurate and reliable?" If you are guessing, the analysis is worthless.
  Estimate numeric outcomes using EMV, decision trees, or Monte Carlo when stakeholders need confidence levels (e.g., "We have an 85% chance of finishing by June").
