# FAQ

## Getting Started
### What is the PMP exam and who is it for?
The PMP (Project Management Professional) is PMI's credential for experienced project managers that validates leadership, process, and business skills across industries.

### Do I meet the PMP eligibility requirements?
You need a four-year degree with 36 months of project leadership experience (or a high school diploma with 60 months) plus 35 hours of project management education.

### What counts as "project leadership experience"?
Leading and directing project work across initiating, planning, executing, monitoring/controlling, and closing. Agile and hybrid leadership experience counts.

### How do I document experience for the application?
Use concise summaries of deliverables, your role, timeframes, and outcomes instead of a list of job duties.

### What if I am audited?
PMI audits a percentage of applications. You will submit proof of education/training and have your supervisor verify your experience.

## Application and Scheduling
### How long does the application review take?
Typically around 5 business days, but audits take longer because verification is required.

### When should I schedule the exam?
Schedule after your application is approved and you have a realistic study window with buffer time.

### Can I reschedule?
Yes, PMI allows rescheduling with fees that increase as the exam date gets closer.

## Exam Format and Logistics

As of the July 2026 ECO update, the exam is listed as 185 questions over 240 minutes. Check PMI for the current format.

### Can I take the exam online?

### What score do I need to pass?
PMI does not publish a numeric passing score; performance is reported by domain.

### What if I fail?
You can retake up to 3 times within a one-year eligibility period, with a fee per attempt.

## Study Plan and Strategy
### How long should I study before taking the exam?
Most candidates prepare 6 to 12 weeks at 8 to 12 hours per week, adjusted for experience and comfort with Agile and hybrid methods.

The exam follows the PMI Exam Content Outline. The July 2026 ECO highlights People (33%), Process (41%), and Business Environment (26%).

### How much Agile is on the PMP exam?
The July 2026 ECO emphasizes a 60/40 split between adaptive or hybrid and predictive approaches.

### How do I build the PMI mindset?
Prioritize servant leadership, value delivery, stakeholder collaboration, and proactive risk management.

### What should I do in the final week?
Focus on reviewing weak areas, redoing missed questions, and taking one or two timed mixed sets.

### What if I am not scoring well on practice exams?
Identify the weakest domains, review the remediation notes, and drill targeted question sets before taking another full mock.

## Training and Contact Hours
### Do I need a 35-hour course?
Yes, PMI requires 35 contact hours of project management education to qualify.

### Does this site count toward the 35 contact hours?

### Does this site replace a training course?
No. It is a study companion and practice tool, not a replacement for formal training.
