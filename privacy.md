## Information We Collect
The Site is designed to minimize data collection. We collect only what is necessary to provide study tools:

### Information You Provide
- **Study Progress**: Answers to practice questions, flashcard progress, and quiz scores
- **Preferences**: Any settings you customize within the Site

### Automatically Collected Information
- **Usage Data**: Pages viewed, features used, and time spent on the Site (processed locally)

### Information We Do NOT Actively Collect
- Names, email addresses, phone numbers, or postal addresses
- Account credentials or passwords
- Payment information (the Site is free and does not accept payments)
- Social media account information
- Geographic location data

## How Information Is Stored
All personal data and study progress are stored **locally on your device** using browser storage technologies (localStorage and cache). This means:

- Your data never leaves your device
- We do not have access to your individual study progress
- We do not store your data on our servers
- If you clear your browser data, your progress will be lost unless you have exported a backup

## Data Export and Backup
The Site provides an export feature that allows you to:

- Download all your progress data as a file
- Transfer your data between devices
- Restore your progress after clearing browser data

This export process happens entirely on your device. The file is generated locally and is not transmitted to any server.

## Information We Do Not Collect
To be clear, the Site does **not** collect:

- Personal identifiers (name, email, phone, address)
- Demographic information
- Biometric information
- Precise geolocation
- Social security or government ID numbers
- Health or financial information
- Payment or credit card details

## No Data Sharing or Selling
We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information. Specifically:

- **No Third-Party Sales**: We do not sell your data to third parties for any purpose
- **No Marketing Sharing**: We do not share your data with third parties for marketing purposes
- **No Data Brokers**: We do not provide data to data brokers
- **No Advertising Networks**: The Site does not display advertisements, so we do not share data with ad networks

## Cookies and Local Storage
The Site uses browser storage technologies to function:

### localStorage
- Stores your study progress, preferences, and settings
- Persists between sessions on the same device
- Is never transmitted to our servers

### Browser Cache
- Stores static assets (images, scripts, stylesheets) to improve load times
- Helps the Site function offline

### Session Storage
- Temporary data that is cleared when you close your browser

You can clear this data at any time through your browser settings. However, doing so will delete your study progress unless you have exported a backup.

## Third-Party Services
The Site may use the following third-party services:

### Hosting and Infrastructure
- The Site is hosted on platforms that may collect basic server logs (IP addresses, request timestamps) for technical maintenance and security purposes
- These logs are not used to identify individual users

### Content Delivery Networks
- Static assets may be delivered through CDNs to improve performance
- CDNs may log technical information such as IP address and browser type

### Links to Third-Party Sites
- The Site may contain links to external resources (e.g., PMI.org)
- We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party sites
- We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit

## Children's Privacy
The Site is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided information to us, please contact us.

## Your Rights and Choices
Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your data:

### Access and Portability
- You can access all your data through the export feature
- You can download your data at any time

### Deletion
- You can delete your data by clearing your browser storage
- You can also use your browser's settings to remove Site data

### Modification
- You can update your preferences and study data directly within the Site

### No Account Means No Account Deletion Request Needed
- Since we do not have accounts or centralized data, there is no account to delete
- All data is under your control on your device

## Data Retention and Deletion
Your data remains on your device until you delete it. We do not retain copies of your data on our servers.

To delete your data:
1. Use the export feature to save a backup (optional)
2. Clear your browser data for this Site through your browser settings
3. Alternatively, use the "Reset Progress" feature if available

## Security
We take reasonable measures to protect the Site, but since all data is stored locally on your device, you play an important role in security:

- Keep your device secure with a password or biometric lock
- Be cautious when exporting data on shared devices
- Delete your data before selling or disposing of your device
- Use a secure and updated browser

## International Data Transfers
Since all data is stored locally on your device, there are no international data transfers. Your data stays where you are.

## California Privacy Rights
If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides you with additional rights. However, because we do not collect personal identifiers or store data centrally:

- We do not sell personal information
- We do not have a database of personal information to access or delete
- Your study data is entirely under your control on your device

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of significant changes by:

- Posting the new policy on this page
- Updating the "Effective Date" at the top
- Noting the changes in a visible location on the Site

Continued use of the Site after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.

## Contact Us
If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us.
