B: Drawing from the management reserve is only appropriate after exhausting contingency reserves and confirming the issue is a true, accepted change to scope or budget baseline, which requires formal documentation and approval.

    "explanation": "CORRECT: When an automated quality tool flags an issue, the immediate quality planning response is to review the established baseline or tolerance levels (statistical control limits) to determine if the deviation is truly a defect or within the acceptable, planned variation. A: This aligns with planning and optimizing quality by validating the parameters of the quality process itself. B: Tapping reserves (Task 6) is a cost response, not a quality optimization/investigation step. C: Changing AI parameters without analysis risks accepting poor quality deliverables prematurely. D: Changing the threshold without understanding the root cause compromises the contractual quality agreement.",

    "questionText": "You are managing a project to optimize supplier onboarding, focusing on achieving measurable incremental benefits related to reduced administrative overhead. After the first three suppliers are onboarded using the new process, the cost tracking shows an unexpected increase in administrative labor hours, although regulatory compliance reporting quality is excellent. What action best supports tracking value delivery and optimizing future quality planning?",
    "scenario": "Early incremental delivery shows high quality in compliance but poor value delivery concerning the intended benefit (reduced admin overhead).",
    "choices": [
      "Investigate the administrative steps where the new process introduced unexpected friction to refine the quality standard for efficiency.",
      "Adjust the project contingency reserve upwards to offset the documented increase in administrative labor costs.",

    "explanation": "CORRECT: Task 7 requires planning quality optimization based on realized performance against intended benefits. Since the benefit (efficiency) is not being realized despite high compliance quality, the team must investigate the process friction to refine the efficiency quality metrics for subsequent iterations. A: This directly addresses quality planning optimization based on value delivery feedback (Task 3 link). B: Adjusting reserves (Task 6) is a financial reaction; it does not fix the quality process causing the inefficiency. C: Re-evaluating estimates is a control activity, but the priority is fixing the process causing the inefficiency first. D: Focusing only on compliance ignores the failure to deliver the planned efficiency benefit.",

    "explanation": "CORRECT: A catastrophic quality failure (15% vs 2% planned) demands immediate process investigation to identify and correct the root cause, which, in automated systems, often resides in the training data or model parameters. B: Stopping the process to investigate the source (model training input) is the proactive quality optimization step. A: Adjusting Management Reserves (Task 6) is a financial/risk response, not the primary quality fix.
