## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the shared package:

   ```bash
   npm run build:shared
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev:web
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev:web` - Start Next.js dev server
- `npm run build:web` - Build for production (static export)
- `npm run serve:static` - Serve the built static site locally
- `npm run build:shared` - Build the shared package
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier

## Building for GitHub Pages

To build with a base path (for GitHub Pages project pages):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/pmp_application npm run build:web
```

The built static files will be in `packages/web/out/`.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml`) that automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when you push to the `master` branch.

**Setup steps:**

1. Go to your repository **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**

The workflow will:
- Build the site with `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/pmp_application`
- Deploy the `packages/web/out` directory to GitHub Pages

### Other Static Hosting

You can deploy the `packages/web/out` directory to any static hosting service:

- **Netlify**: Deploy the `out` directory
- **Vercel**: Import repository (auto-detects Next.js)
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Deploy the `out` directory

For custom domains or root deployment (not in a subdirectory), build without the base path:

```bash
npm run build:web
```

## Data Storage

All progress is stored locally in your browser using localStorage:

- **Flashcard progress**: Leitner box system with spaced repetition
- **Practice history**: Quiz attempts and scores
- **Streak tracking**: Daily activity streaks

**Note**: Clearing your browser data will reset your progress. There's no cloud sync.

## Content

- **1,800+ flashcards** covering all PMP domains
- **1,200+ practice questions** with detailed explanations
- **Study guides** aligned with the 2026 PMP ECO
- **Formula reference** and calculator
