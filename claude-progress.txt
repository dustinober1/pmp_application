## Task Description
Analyze the PMP application codebase and create specialized agents/workers for ongoing development. This includes:
1. Database/Prisma schema management and migration agents
2. API route and service layer scaffolding agents
3. Frontend component and page generation agents
4. Test generation and coverage management agents
5. Authentication and subscription tier feature agents
6. Spaced repetition (SM-2) algorithm tuning agents
7. Content management (study guides, questions, flashcards) agents
8. Team/corporate feature development agents

The goal is to create reusable agent configurations, templates, and tools that can be invoked for future development tasks.

## Feature Status
✅ [COMPLETED] feature-1: Analyze existing codebase structure and identify patterns
✅ [COMPLETED] feature-2: Create database/Prisma schema management agent - handles schema changes, migrations, and seed data
✅ [COMPLETED] feature-3: Create API route and service layer scaffolding agent - generates standardized route+service pairs with validation
✅ [COMPLETED] feature-4: Create frontend component generator agent - generates Next.js components with TypeScript and Tailwind
✅ [COMPLETED] feature-5: Create test generation agent - generates Jest tests with property-based testing support
✅ [COMPLETED] feature-6: Create authentication feature agent - handles JWT, refresh tokens, password resets
✅ [COMPLETED] feature-7: Create subscription tier agent - manages tier features, limits, and enforcement middleware
✅ [COMPLETED] feature-8: Create spaced repetition tuning agent - optimizes SM-2 algorithm parameters based on performance data
✅ [COMPLETED] feature-9: Create content management agent - handles study guides, questions, flashcards CRUD operations
✅ [COMPLETED] feature-10: Create team/corporate feature agent - manages teams, invitations, alerts, and admin features
✅ [COMPLETED] feature-11: Create documentation generator - keeps CLAUDE.md and API docs in sync with codebase
