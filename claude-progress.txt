## Task Description
Fix E2E Playwright tests for PMP Study Application

Context:
- All 431 unit tests pass ✅
- Coverage above 80% ✅
- E2E tests exist but have Playwright configuration issues

E2E Test Issues:
The E2E tests in packages/web/e2e/ are failing with "Playwright Test did not expect test.describe() to be called here" errors. This typically indicates:
1. Missing or incorrect playwright.config.ts
2. Test files importing wrong test runner
3. Multiple versions of @playwright/test

Files to fix:
- e2e/checkout.spec.ts - Checkout/Payment flow with PayPal
- e2e/exam.spec.ts - Exam Simulation flow  
- e2e/flashcard.spec.ts - Flashcard flow

Goal:
- Configure Playwright properly
- Get all E2E tests runnable
- Ensure happy path tests pass for critical user flows
