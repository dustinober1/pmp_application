## Task Description
Convert PMP Study Pro to 100% static site for GitHub Pages deployment. 

The plan consists of 9 phases from static_plan.md:

1. Remove auth, middleware, billing, and team features
2. Make Next export work with basePath configuration
3. Move data into public/ and add typed loaders
4. Create local storage data model + utilities
5. Rewrite all routes (landing, study, flashcards, practice, dashboard, donate)
6. Remove backend packages and unused dependencies
7. QA checklist validation
8. GitHub Pages deployment workflow
9. Update documentation

Key requirements from static_plan.md:
- Remove ALL auth, subscriptions, checkout, team features
- Export with 'output: "export"' in next.config.js
- Move flashcards data (data/flashcards-combined.json) to public/data/flashcards.json
- Move questions data (packages/api/prisma/seed-data/testbank.json) to public/data/questions.json
- Create local-only flashcards/play and practice/play routes
- Create localStorage-based progress tracking with spaced repetition
- Create donation page instead of checkout
- All pages must work without API/backend

The goal is a 100% static site that can be deployed to GitHub Pages with no database or API requirements.
