## Task Description
Add Data Management section to the PMP dashboard with Export/Import Progress functionality to prevent data loss from cache clearing.

**Requirements:**
1. **Export Button**: "Download Progress" button that gathers all localStorage study data and saves as pmp_progress_backup.json
2. **Import Button**: File input that reads exported JSON and restores data to localStorage
3. **Success Feedback**: Toast notification or text update on successful import
4. **UI Integration**: "Data Portability" card in dashboard grid with info tooltip explaining: "Since this site is static and serverless, use these buttons to move your progress between devices or back up your data before clearing your browser cache."
5. **Data Sync**: Dashboard reactive elements (Progress Circles: People 33%, Process 41%, Business Environment 26%) refresh immediately after import
6. **Updated Privacy Warning**: Change CacheWarningBanner message to: "⚠️ Progress is stored locally. To avoid losing data when clearing cache, use the Export Progress tool on the Dashboard."

**Technical Context:**
- Dashboard at packages/web-svelte/src/routes/dashboard/+page.svelte
- Local storage keys in lib/constants/storageKeys.ts
- Stores in lib/stores/dashboard.ts
- Use Svelte 5 syntax ($state, $derived)
- JSON should include: domain progress, study stats, recent activity, flashcard data, mock exam scores

✅ [COMPLETED] feature-4: Update CacheWarningBanner.svelte message to: '⚠️ Progress is stored locally. To avoid losing data when clearing cache, use the Export Progress tool on the Dashboard.'
✅ [COMPLETED] feature-5: Integrate DataPortabilityCard into dashboard grid layout, add data refresh trigger after import using Svelte stores, ensure reactive components update when localStorage changes
