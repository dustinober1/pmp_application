## Task Description
Fix and improve the PMP Study Pro application - a static SvelteKit app with no backend. All data should be loaded from static JSON files and stored in localStorage. The app has critical issues where pages call non-existent backend APIs. Need to migrate to static data loading, implement interactive flashcard study mode with spaced repetition, add filtering/search, and fix various UX issues.
