## Task Description
Execute comprehensive frontend testing implementation for PMP Study Application to meet Production Readiness Review (PRR) standards.

**Goal:** Achieve production-ready testing with:
1. Unit Test Coverage > 80% (currently at 65-75% threshold)
2. E2E Tests covering "Happy Path" for Payments (Checkout/PayPal)
3. E2E Tests covering "Happy Path" for Exam Simulation
4. All PRR sign-off criteria met in "Code Quality & Testing" section

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript
- Unit Tests: Vitest with React Testing Library
- E2E Tests: Playwright
- Monorepo: npm workspaces (packages/web, packages/api, packages/shared)

**Current State:**
- Many test files created but untracked (see git status):
  - E2E: checkout.spec.ts, exam.spec.ts, flashcard.spec.ts
  - Unit: 18+ .test.tsx files for pages and components
- Coverage threshold currently set to 65-75%, need to reach 80%+
- Critical user flows: Registration, Checkout (PayPal), Exam Simulation

**Testing Requirements:**
1. Run coverage analysis to identify gaps
2. Write/improve unit tests for >80% coverage
3. Implement complete E2E happy path tests for:
   - Registration → Subscription Selection → PayPal Checkout → Dashboard
   - Login → Start Exam → Answer Questions → Submit → Results
   - Flashcard study flows with spaced repetition
4. Ensure all tests pass in CI
5. Generate final coverage report

## Feature Status
⏳ [PENDING] feature-1: Coverage assessment and baseline - Run Vitest with coverage to identify gaps, verify all new test files run without errors, create prioritized list of coverage gaps by business criticality (auth > pay
... (truncated)
   Error: Swarm worker system having initialization issues. Will run tests directly instead.
⏳ [PENDING] feature-2: E2E tests for Checkout/Payment flow - Implement complete happy path: Registration → Subscription Selection → PayPal Checkout → Dashboard Access. Verify payment processing and subscription tier activat
... (truncated)
⏳ [PENDING] feature-3: E2E tests for Exam Simulation flow - Implement complete happy path: Login → Start Exam → Answer Questions → Submit → View Results. Verify timer functionality, question randomization, and scoring accur
... (truncated)
⏳ [PENDING] feature-4: E2E tests for Flashcard flow - Implement happy path: Browse flashcards → Study session → Rate cards (spaced repetition) → Track progress. Verify SR algorithm integration.
⏳ [PENDING] feature-5: Unit test coverage boost for Auth pages - Achieve >85% coverage for: login, register, forgot-password, reset-password, verify-email pages and components. Include form validation, error handling, redir
... (truncated)
⏳ [PENDING] feature-6: Unit test coverage boost for Study/Practice pages - Achieve >85% coverage for: study pages, practice sessions, question display, timer, results. Include edge cases for timer expiration, session state 
... (truncated)
⏳ [PENDING] feature-7: Unit test coverage boost for Core Components - Achieve >85% coverage for: providers (ThemeProvider, I18nProvider), layout components, middleware, utilities (logger, API client), Skeleton components.
⏳ [PENDING] feature-8: Final verification and summary report - Run full test suite (unit + E2E), generate final coverage report, fix any failing tests, document coverage metrics against PRR criteria, create summary report
