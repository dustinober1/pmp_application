## Task Description
Fix authentication blocks and ensure consistent, interactive UI/UX across all pages of the PMP Study Pro website.

Issues identified:
1. Study pages (/study and /study/[taskId]) are blocked by unnecessary authentication checks - remove auth guards since this is a free public site
2. UI/UX inconsistency between homepage (beautiful glassmorphism, gradients, animations) and other pages (plain gray backgrounds)
3. Study page has duplicate Navbar component - should use the layout like other pages
4. Missing interactive elements (hover effects, scale transforms, transitions) on dashboard, flashcards, and practice pages

Goal: Make all pages render without auth blocks and have the same polished, interactive feel as the homepage with consistent:
- Glassmorphism effects
- Gradient backgrounds
- Hover animations (scale, shadow, translate)
- Color schemes
- Interactive elements
