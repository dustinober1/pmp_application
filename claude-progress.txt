## Task Description
Analyze the PMP application codebase and create specialized agents/workers for ongoing development. This includes:
1. Database/Prisma schema management and migration agents
2. API route and service layer scaffolding agents
3. Frontend component and page generation agents
4. Test generation and coverage management agents
5. Authentication and subscription tier feature agents
6. Spaced repetition (SM-2) algorithm tuning agents
7. Content management (study guides, questions, flashcards) agents
8. Team/corporate feature development agents

The goal is to create reusable agent configurations, templates, and tools that can be invoked for future development tasks.
