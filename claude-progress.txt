## Task Description
Fix the import/loading of flashcards and practice questions into the PMP application.

**Problem:**
Flashcards and practice pages are trying to call APIs (flashcardApi, practiceApi, contentApi) that don't exist. The data is stored locally in /data directory (flashcards-combined.json and testbank.json) but the pages are not loading from these files.

**Data Sources:**
- /data/flashcards-combined.json - 515KB, contains flashcards with meta/flashcards structure
- /data/testbank.json - 3.5MB, contains practice questions

**Requirements:**
1. Update flashcards +page.ts to load from local JSON instead of API
2. Update practice +page.server.ts to load from local JSON instead of API
3. Ensure data types match the expected structures
4. Keep pagination working for flashcards
5. Keep stats calculation working
6. Remove dependency on non-existent APIs

**Technical Context:**
- SvelteKit app at packages/web-svelte/
- Routes: /flashcards (+page.ts, +page.svelte) and /practice (+page.server.ts, +page.svelte)
- Shared types in packages/shared/src/types/
- Using Svelte 5 syntax

## Feature Status
✅ [COMPLETED] feature-1: Create flashcardsData.ts utility in lib/utils/ that imports and processes flashcards-combined.json with proper TypeScript types, pagination support, and domain/task filtering
✅ [COMPLETED] feature-2: Update flashcards +page.ts to use flashcardsData utility instead of flashcardApi, remove API imports, load data from local JSON file
   Error: Failed (will retry)
✅ [COMPLETED] feature-3: Create practiceData.ts utility in lib/utils/ that imports and processes testbank.json with proper TypeScript types for questions, domains, and stats
✅ [COMPLETED] feature-4: Update practice +page.server.ts to use practiceData utility instead of practiceApi/contentApi, remove API imports, load data from local JSON file
✅ [COMPLETED] feature-5: Test build to ensure no TypeScript errors and both pages load correctly with local data
