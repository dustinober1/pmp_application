## Task Description
Update the PMP Study Pro static site to align with the PMP Exam Content Outline (ECO) effective July 2026.

Key changes needed:
1. Add a prominent, high-contrast Privacy & Progress Warning at the very top of the landing page with text: '⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is a free, open-source static site. Your progress is stored locally in your browser's cache. If you clear your browser cache or site data, all your tracking and progress will be permanently lost.' Remove any existing redundant privacy notices at the bottom.

2. Replace the current domain section with three responsive, reactive cards showing the 2026 PMP ECO weightings:
   - People (33%): Focus on soft skills and leadership
   - Process (41%): Technical management of projects  
   - Business Environment (26%): Major Increase — strategic alignment, compliance, and organizational value

3. Create a separate '2026 Key Themes' grid with reactive boxes for:
   - AI Integration: Use of GenAI for scheduling, risk, and data analysis
   - Sustainability & ESG: Environmental and social governance considerations
   - Methodology Shift: 60% Adaptive/Hybrid vs. 40% Predictive/Waterfall
   - Exam Logistics: 185 Questions over 240 Minutes

4. Design Requirements:
   - Modern, glassmorphism or card-based design with subtle hover states
   - Mobile-first responsive layout (stacking on small screens, grid on desktop)
   - Maintain the existing 'Free and Open Source' branding
