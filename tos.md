The Site does not provide the 35 contact hours required by PMI for exam eligibility. We may add a 35-hour course in the future, but it is not currently available.

## 8. No Guarantee of Results
Using the Site does not guarantee that you will pass the PMP exam or meet PMI eligibility requirements. Your results depend on your experience, study habits, and the official PMI exam requirements.
