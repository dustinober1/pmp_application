## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive security assessment of the PMP Study Application, including static analysis (SAST), dependency scanning, container security, infrastructure validation, and secrets detection.

---

## 1. Dependency Security Scan

✅ No vulnerabilities found in dependencies

## 2. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

⚠️ Potential sensitive data logging detected

## 3. Container Security

✅ API Dockerfile uses non-root user

✅ API Dockerfile uses minimal Alpine base image

## 4. Infrastructure Security (Terraform)

⚠️ No explicit encryption configurations found in Terraform

✅ No critical Terraform security issues detected

## 5. Secrets Detection

⚠️ Potential API keys found in configuration files

## 6. Security Best Practices

⚠️ .env files found (ensure they're in .gitignore)

✅ Helmet.js security headers package detected

✅ CORS configuration detected

✅ Rate limiting implementation detected

## 7. Overall Security Score

### Scan Statistics

- **Total Checks:** 11
- **Passed:** 7 ✅
- **Failed:** 0 ❌
- **Warnings:** 4 ⚠️

### Security Score: 100/100

[0;32m### Security Grade: A - Excellent (100/100)[0m

## 8. Recommendations & Remediation Plan

### High Priority (Address within 30 days)

1. **Review all WARN findings**
   - Assess risk level for each warning
   - Create backlog items for remediation
   - Schedule fixes based on risk

### Continuous Improvement

1. **Enable all GitHub Actions security workflows**
   - SAST scans on every commit
   - Dependency scanning daily
   - Container scanning on push

2. **Implement security training**
   - OWASP Top 10 awareness
   - Secure coding practices
   - Incident response procedures

3. **Regular security reviews**
   - Quarterly penetration testing
   - Annual third-party security audit
   - Monthly security team meetings

4. **Monitor and respond**
   - Set up Security Hub integration
   - Configure alerting for critical findings
   - Establish incident response runbooks

## Next Steps

1. Review this report with the engineering team
2. Create GitHub issues for each FAIL/WARN finding
3. Prioritize remediation based on risk
4. Update security baseline documentation
5. Schedule follow-up security scan in 30 days
